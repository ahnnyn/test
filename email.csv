Subject: SAP Financials Data Warehouse Update 07/18/2000


Below is an update on the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse Project.  Information 
has been divided into five areas: Infrastructure, Software, Rapid Mart 
Configuration, 'People' involved with project, and Training.  

Each area has a status color associated with it indicating how the project is 
done in terms of schedule.  RED represents trouble areas we are addressing, 
YELLOW represents potential slippage we are addressing and Green is for items 
""in good shape"".  I am preparing an MS Project file and will publish it later 
this week to illustrate timelines in a graphical format.


I. INFRASTRUCTURE ACQUISITION and PREPARATION: RED

ACTA Application Server (UNIX):  Configured and being tested. 
ACTA Database Server (UNIX):  Received 7/7/2000.  O/S being added, internal 
drives on order (due 7/19), adding of Oracle DB Software will follow.  Target 
date to start Acta install and configuration is 7/26/2000.  
UNIX Database Storage: On order, due 8/9, estimated ready date 8/17.  Sense 
Corp. agrees that we can install and configure ACTA using internal drives 
until Storage arrives.  Not as critical to delivery date since initial Rapid 
Mart configuration can proceed using extra internal storage drives added to 
DB server (item 2 above).  Storage to be ready for install mid-August.
BRIO Broadcast Report and On-Demand Query Application Server (UNIX):  Ordered 
from SUN vendor 7/11/2000. 
Intranet WEB Server (UNIX):  Ordered from SUN vendor 7/11/2000.
Connectivity:  System Requirements forwarded to all technical contacts 
(7/18).  Meeting Thursday (7/20) with all technical groups and Sense Corp. 
consultant to cover ACTA System Requirements Document and ensure everyone 
understands details and can deliver on or before 7/26 target date.
The hardware mentioned in items 1 - 5 above make-up the DEV/QA environment 
for the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse.  The UNIX Infrastructure group 
recommendation is still to hold off ordering the Production environment 
machines.  Two reasons were cited:  
Wait so the performance of the DEV/QA boxes can be tested and determine if 
models originally identified for Production will be sufficient.
Wait to get feedback from customer groups on the value of the Data Warehouse 
deliverable and concept.  Frequently, Data Warehouses catch on quickly with 
the user community and they push to include much more information (in our 
case non-SAP data) into the data warehouse than originally anticipated.  


II. SOFTWARE ACQUISITION:  Green

ACTA software is purchased, in-house and paid for - installation awaits 
database server.
Confirmed that additional funds will not be needed for Oracle database 
software.  Meeting with GSS rep. Laine Borgman, Oracle rep. and NET WORKS 
contact Bob McAuliffe Monday 7/17 confirmed Enron has an enterprise license 
for the Oracle DB package.
BRIO Reporting and Querying software is in-house as free trial license 
through 7/31/00.  Tool has been selected by Enron Company business and IT 
group and is final stages of purchase process.  Target completion date is 
this Wednesday (7/19).  
Initial meeting on BRIO Training Wednesday (7/19) with Tennyson Group.  
Information and issues will be taken to initial Reporting Council meeting 
(7/27).


III. RAPID MART CONFIGURATION (Phase One of Project): YELLOW

ACTA consulting Partner, Sense Corp., is lined up to install ACTA and 
configuration of Rapid Marts.  Their paperwork for IT, HR and A/P is 
currently being completed.  
Received and reviewed Sense Corp. project plan and resource rates.  Project's 
budget can pay for Project Mgr. and two Acta Extraction Developers during 
Phases One and  Two, based on savings experienced on reporting and querying 
tool. 
Schedule is 2-3 weeks per Rapid Mart, if architecture, security and IDs are 
completely prepared prior to Sense Corp. arrival.  This makes best case 
scenario of first Rapid Mart delivery 8/9 -8/16.


IV. PEOPLE: YELLOW

Reporting Council representatives:
Requested in July 7th email to CAOs and cc: to SAP Site Managers.  
12 reps. have been named to-date.  
Kickoff meeting for all members scheduled for 7/27.  Agenda to include 
overview of council role, project objectives, obtain council member's 
recommendations for the process of report identification, prioritization and 
feedback to developers on finished product (feedback loop).
Technical contacts:  
Obtained contacts for all groups UNIX Infrastructure (Mike Barber and Gary 
Law), DBAs (Douglas Cummins), Networking (Keith Dziadek), SAP Technical - 
Database and ABAP (Tracy Terrell).  
Provided each with written System Requirements 7/18/2000.  
Kickoff meeting with Sense Corp. consultant to confirm pre-installation 
checklist on Thursday, July 20th.
SAP Technical Analysts/Developers:
Held meetings with Mark Schmidt and Kathy Kokas regarding SAP/COE resources.
Interviews with recommended resources this week and next.
COE / SAP resources will be charging time to project, whether they are Enron 
employees or contractors.  This was not incorporated in the initial project 
budget and may cause the project to go over budget.  (Specifics will follow 
once resources are confirmed and their rates identified).    
Reporting and Querying Tool Lead and Developers:
Requested a reporting tool lead and developers from initial project companies 
(GPG has 5-6 EDS Developers who are budgeted for SAP ABAP reports and will 
now take BRIO Training. 3-4 additional resources are being requested through 
EES IT Outsourcing Deal to IBM with no additional cost to ENRON or project.  


V. TRAINING:  Green

ACTA TRAINING:
ACTA training will be given for the first 3 days of the ACTA software 
installation.  Up to 8 Enron resources can attend.  This will be scheduled 
shortly, in conjunction with availability of on DEV/QA environment and Acta 
training consultant. Target date 7/26-28.  
Confirm 8 individuals who will support ACTA: Contacts Michael Barber (2?)  
Douglas Cummins (2?) Operations (?) SAP Technical (3?).  
BRIO REPORTING and QUERYING TOOL:
Training classes for 10 BRIO Support Contacts across Enron are included in 
BRIO contract.  Travel expenses to California training site paid by Enron

partner, the Tennyson Group.  Meeting with Tennyson Group on Wednesday 7/20 
for training overview, recommendations, issues, etc.  These items will then

Dear Premium Member:

Do you need income now, or will you need it in the near
future? Have you made considerable money and now wish to protect
it? Are you retired?

Answer yes to any one of these questions and you'll want to
learn more about Bonds. And if you haven't looked at bonds in a
while, you're in for a surprise. They've changed. There are more
types, more bond funds, and more volatility.

So, we suggest you make your first bond venture boning up on
bonds. We've made that very easy, and even added a lot of fun to
the process, too! (Not to mention the great rewards you can get.)

Just try our new Investing Classroom Bond track at
http://www.morningstar.com/RD/BondTrack.html?memail=prem

You'll find 20 courses divided into two sections. They take
you from the basics to information about specific types of bonds.
Here's a sampling of the topics you'll master easily and quickly:

Bonds 100:
Bond Market Interest Rates
Bond Duration
Buying Bonds
Immunization
The Process of Issuing Bonds
..plus five more

Bonds 200:
Collateralized Mortgage Obligation
Zero Coupon Securities
TIGRs, CATS, AND LIONs
STRIPS
Treasury Inflation-Adjusted Securities
..plus five more

There's more, too. After each course, you'll reinforce your
knowledge with a short quiz. And you'll get credits for each
question you answer correctly. Our new Bond track gives you the
chance to pick up 100 credits. That's enough for some pretty
handsome rewards.

You can redeem your credits for great Morningstar Rewards.
These include gear like our fleece pullover. Or redeem them for

Greetings everyone.  I just wanted to thank all of you for coming to the
housewarming party.  It meant a lot that so many of you came from far away
(Seattle and Grants Pass) for me, and helped me welcome in my new home.  I
also wanted to thank those of you were so kind and treated me to present.  I
didn't expect that, but fully loved it.  Thanks again for making it so much
fun.

Oh---I will probably be single by this weekend, so I am thinking we should
party on cinco de Mayo. I am giving Bart the boot. Let me know if something
fun is going on.  Talk to you all soon.

Luvins,
Elizah"

The ISO (K Robb) circulated the ISO's position on the Def Penalties this
PM. It is attached.

As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.

Having said that I offer the following:

The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.

In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.

What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?

The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return
of the PARs).

BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.

rstalter@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the
request of
Steven Keller of the NY PSC:


Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
""optimistic"" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with 
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the 
assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:

Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.  

I'll keep you posted when I hear from him."

Will ESAT still be the signatory to the contract as agent for the Brazilian

Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or 
loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit.  
Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger.

Subject: CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring

Here's the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that 
will appear in Monday's CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward (there is 
a hard copy in your box).

CQ WEEKLY - ENERGY 
Apr. 22, 2000 
Page 949 
Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric> Deregulation
By James C. Benton, CQ Staff 
At the dawn of the year, it seemed Congress would be content to let the 
current session end without moving legislation to encourage further 
deregulation of the nation's $220 billion <electric> market. But developments 
in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation, 
as well as the Clinton administration, are building a consensus that will put 
pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year.
On April 6, a group called the <Electricity> Restructuring Stakeholders -- 
representing consumers, <electric> generating companies, senior citizens and 
others -- released a set of goals they believe should be included in 
restructuring legislation. The principles include repeal of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (<PUHCA>) and changes to a 1978 law (PL 
95-617) that required state utility commissions and <utilities> to reform 
their <electric> rates and take other measures to even out daily <electric> 
consumption. (1978 CQ Almanac, p. 639)
The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify 
other areas where common ground can be reached, said Joe Nipper, chief 
lobbyist for the American Public Power Association.
A smaller trade group, composed mainly of investor-owned <utilities>, is 
working on its own set of principles.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an 
April 17 speech to the National Energy Marketers Association, and he urged 
Congress to pass an <electric> restructuring bill.
""Our interstate <electricity> markets are in need of repair,"" Richardson 
said, adding that <transmission> access and generation capacity are 
decreasing as demand for <electricity> grows. ""If Congress fails to act -- 
and act soon -- on restructuring legislation, it will strangle the 
development of competitive <electricity> markets.""
The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan 
have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the 106th Congress. But 
they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar, 
election-year politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues 
on how to rewrite or repeal <PUHCA>.
On April 27, Senate Energy Chairman Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, will hold 
the last of three hearings on eight <electric> deregulation-related measures.
On the House side, retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., 
R-Va., has vowed to work toward enacting a bill (HR 2944) to encourage 
further state deregulation of the <electric> utility market. That measure, 
which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone, not 
just the nearest utility, was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on 
Energy and Power on Oct. 27. (CQ Weekly, p. 478; 1999 CQ Weekly, p. 2599)
The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a 
competitive market but contains no deadline, or ""date certain,"" by which 
states would have to restructure.
Moving a Senate Bill
Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome 
this year. For example, while they have made progress on principles, the key 
negotiators -- representing investor-owned <utilities>; <electric> 
cooperatives; municipal <electric> <utilities>; large <electricity> 
consumers; labor unions, and environmental groups -- still must reach 
consensus on details the legislation should address, as well as the 
legislative language to implement any agreement.
""I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low, not from 
the lack of trying,"" Nipper said.
The best chance appears to lie in the Senate, where Murkowski's committee is 
considering eight bills. ""I am committed to getting something meaningful out 
of my committee,"" Murkowski said in an April 14 interview. Murkowski 
acknowledged, though, that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on 
each of the bills pose challenges to his goal -- developing a comprehensive 
deregulation bill, not one that only addresses portions of <electric> 
restructuring.
The path in the House appears more difficult, although one key supporter said 
there is behind-the-scenes movement.
Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR 2944 before Memorial Day, and he 
has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee.
Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, the sponsor of HR 2944, said meetings are taking 
place among Bliley, Republican House staffers and some interested groups. 
""There is some action; it's just not visible,"" Barton said late last month. 
""I think what's happening there is that [stakeholders are] jockeying for 
position.""
Barton said he anticipated that a ""fairly good bill"" could be moved by the 
middle of May if stakeholders and members come together.
One complication: Democrats, in the midst of the battle to regain control of 
the House, may not move toward a consensus with Republicans. Staff aides for 
several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from 
the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee.
But others point to a 1992 energy law (PL 102-486) that cleared Congress in 
the weeks before that year's election. It contained provisions allowing <
utilities> and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power 
market; that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in 
some markets. So far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have either 
restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in 
coming years. (1992 Almanac, p. 231)
Mark Stultz, a spokesman for the <Electric> <Power> Supply Association, a 
group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers, said the 1992 law 
was enacted after the <electric> industry quickly built up a consensus among 
members and educated them on what the bill would do.
""The industry was able to access that in a very short time,"" Stultz said. As 
far as getting a restructuring bill through this year, Stultz said it is ""not 
an impossible, unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus,"" 
since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues. They include 
blocking ""market power"" -- the ability of a few companies to stunt 
competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated 
market to its advantage.
While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with, Stultz 
said it also contains some fatal flaws. He cited as an example its lack of 
federal agency jurisdiction over ""bundled"" services in a regulated market, in 
which <electric> generation, <transmission> and distribution rates are 
combined in an <electric> bill, and ""unbundled"" services in a deregulated 
market, in which the generation rates are broken apart from <transmission> 
and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation 
are included.
Best Bets in the Senate
Of the eight bills pending in the Senate, Nipper said the one with the best 
chance of passing is S 2071, sponsored by Slade Gorton, R-Wash., which is 
intended to encourage greater <electric> <reliability>. Nipper said the 
Gorton bill would replace the North American <Electric> <Reliability> 
Council, a group in which utility participation is voluntary, with the <
Electric> <Reliability> Organization, a board that would require 
participation by <utilities>. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would 
have jurisdiction over the board, as well as the power to enforce its 
policies on <utilities>.
The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months, due to 
problems <electric> <utilities> faced each of the past two summers. While 
some plants were undergoing needed maintenance, some <utilities> were caught 
with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand. 
The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk <electric> prices, driving 
the price of a megawatt-hour of <electricity> in a few places from $30 to as 
high as $7,000. <Utilities> enforced rotating blackouts on customers, asked 
consumers to reduce <electric> use and passed on surcharges for the higher 
cost of <electricity>.
Hoping to avoid outages this summer, the Department of Energy has scheduled 
four regional ""summits"" on <electric> <reliability> on April 24 and 28.
Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison <Electric> Institute, said a third 
consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases 
could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill. ""It might push this 
thing up further on the congressional radar screen,"" although a law enacted 
immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and <transmission> 
reliability, he said.
Other thorny issues include:
? How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned <utilities>, <electric
> cooperatives and municipal <utilities>, and whether <utilities> should 
voluntarily join, or be forced to join, ""regional <transmission> 
organizations"" designed to allow more efficient transfer of <electricity> 
across the national grid.
? Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the 
interstate <transmission> of <electric> <power>. Some stakeholders argue 
federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from 
protecting its customers at the expense of others.
? Environmental groups' desire for stronger anti-pollution restrictions on <
utilities> that produce pollutants while generating <electricity>. And labor 
groups, wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through 
corporate mergers and acquisitions, want to make sure their union members are 
protected.

To summarize where we are on the accounting issues related to booking all of the income related to our 12.5% equity investment in Kiodex in Q1:

The 12.5% equity investment has to be a completely separate transaction from the co-marketing arrangement for which we are paid in warrants.

Kiodex cannot clawback or redeem any portion of the 12.5% if Enron walks the co-marketing agreement at any point in the five-year term.  It is ours to keep.

The 12.5% equity investment will be collapsed with the co-marketing deal (and therefore income can only be realized over the five-year term) if there isn't enough consideration for the 12.5% to make it look like a real deal.  Mike Patrick believes that we can get the desired accounting treatment for the 12.5% if we deliver promotional materials to our customers and EnronOnline ""statistics"" as consideration for the 12.5%.  We have not really spelled out exactly what this consideration is, but I have attached a draft stock purchase agreement in which we have attempted to do so in Section 5.11.

Kiodex wants to close this deal by March 7; we probably can't get the consideration in line by then, but we probably could by the end of the quarter.  Kiodex wasn't crazy about giving us the 12.5% for anything less than the 5-year marketing agreement, and wanted a clawback on the shares even then; they sure won't give us 12.5% for a promise to deliver the consideration by the end of March.  This means we will have to close the deal into escrow, and can get the shares when we deliver the consideration.

Here are the questions for the deal team:

1.	  What can we give to Kiodex before the end of Q1 that supports our 12.5% equity investment.  I can describe the promotional materials, but what ""statistics"" can we provide that will be valuable to Kiodex?  (Remember that Kiodex will have to feel like they are getting SOMETHING for the 12.5% equity they are giving us, because again, it will be ours to keep regardless of what happens to the co-marketing agreement).

2.	 Whatever we decide to give to Kiodex for the 12.5%, we will have to be able to deliver it IN FULL by the end of Q1; otherwise, we can't get our shares, and we can't book the income.

Here is the stock purchase agreement; I wam working on the language in Section 5.11, but it gives you an idea of what we think we might be able to do.

Sally, 
I'm sorry I left you off my original note but I wanted you to know......

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.

Dear Jeff

Thanks for the message. Yes, a great pity we missed each other. If I had
known of your timetable constraints we could have discussed possibilities at
the reception. I sympathised with what you had to say at the symposium and
would like to learn more.

I have just arrived in Washington DC, where I shall be until Saturday, then
returning to UK. I have a meeting tomorrow (Thursday) morning but otherwise
would be free to meet, if you were planning to be over here. Another
possibility might be to talk on the phone. Tel 202 363 3350 c/o Lois
Godiksen, though I call in at LECG tomorrow afternoon.  Or of course I
should be pleased to see you in UK.  I shall be there next week, then in
Japan for a week, then likely to be in UK for rest of December. I am
normally in Birmingham rather than London, but it would not be too difficult
to get to London for a meeting. I had wondered about the possiblity of
coming to the American Economic Association meetings in New Orleans in early
January, after which I would come up to DC again. That might be another
opportunity to get together.

I did talk to David Teece briefly, and he mentioned a possible joint venture
with several companies, without naming them - is this what you are referring
to? He said very little about it so I would welcome a discussion.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes

Stephen

Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.

Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders.

Don't know if this will still reach you - over here Enron staff have all
been denied access to terminals.  Will try and phone.

Worried about you both - will the Standard Power offer mean you might still
be ok?  What has the collapse meant for you both?  Is there anything I can
do to help?

Thinking of you - can't really believe it

Subject: Re: Part-time exempt employees  

Felicia,

In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before 
someone can be classified as exempt.  However, because there are certain 
exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not 
have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to 
whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.

My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by 
these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If 
they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them 
affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the 
overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the 
overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not 
be an issue.

Let me know if you have questions.

Michelle

Subject: Part-time exempt employees

Sharon and Michelle,

We have 29 employees in the payroll system that are part-time exempt 
employees and their pay is calculated on an hourly rate.  Unless I understand 
the FLSA incorrectly we cannot in any way calculate salaries on exempt 
employees on an hourly basis.  If they are reduced hours we would need to 
determine how we would value their job based on a salary basis otherwise we 
are treating them as hourly employees and not exempt employees.   An exempt 
employee should only be tracking exception time (i.e. sick, vacation, etc -- 
any off duty time) but not work hours during the day.   An exempt worker 
according the FLSA can only be paid on a fee basis or salary basis -- not on 
an hourly basis.  If I am off base let me know, otherwise I would like your 
help with how we should approach getting this corrected and possibly having 
this covered in a policy on how to deal with employees performing exempt jobs 
that are working part-time or reduced schedules. 

Look forward to hearing back from you.

Felecia

Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. is NOT and approved reference 
credit because this entity does not prepare independent financials.  Duke 
Energy Trading and Marketing's ""A-"" S&P rating is based on implied credit 
support from Duke Energy which owns a substantial portion of the entity's 
membership equity.  Our policy thus far is that all reference credit must (i) 
be S&P rated and (ii) prepare entity level financials.

Dear All

Further to the PRC Committee Meeting please find attached the first draft of 
the peer group mapping by function. It was decided that each member would 
review the proposal to move from 4 peer groups to 3 for Mid Year. 

The attached was completed some weeks ago by the HR leads in your business 
Unit and is based on a McKinsey study requested by Jeff Skilling and Steve 
Kean.

Under your review of the attached information, please focus on the final two 
pages that show the 'strawman' on how the functions fell out under the 
proposed peer group 
structure.

I have copied in the HR leads for your business area. They have been 
instrumental in completing the mapping and will meet with you to provide any 
specific information you require concerning placements with your business 
area.

I would point out that there does appear to be some inconsistencies in 
function placements within the peer groups for some business units; it will 
be our primary focus at the next meeting to resolves these issues.

Your assistants have been contacted regarding the time and date of our next 
meeting under separate cover. For our London colleagues we will aim for a 
morning meeting.


David Oxley

To all:

We will fly into Dubuque Friday April 20th and stay overnight.  We are going
to a wedding on the 21st in Minneapolis and will return to Dubuque on Sunday
the 22nd.  We will then be in Dubuque until Wednesday the 25th (we fly out
late on the 25th).  Hope to see you all, but we'll settle for some.

We already have our first wild fire of the season.  It was yet another
controlled burn that got out of control near Ruidoso - quite a distance from
here.  45 mile per hour winds are expected for tomorrow.  New Mexico burnin'
again.  Good luck to us all.  Diane and I have appointments set up with two
insurance agents in order to evaluate our insurance coverage.

Take care.

Frank - 

There appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address (my fault, not 
yours) and I have just now seen your note from yesterday morning.  I am 
working on the Posting Agreement.  I'm afraid Louise may have thought more 
highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than I 
deserved but we will try and get that to you soon.  Travis McCullough, our 
corporate lawyer, will get together a term sheet on the equity side of things 
which we should be able to get to you quickly (no later than Thursday if his 
schedule permits).  I'm assuming that your legal team will have to be 
draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term sheet should 
give them a good starting point (and let you confirm that the lawyers on both 
sides are getting it right).

Sorry for the delay and confusion - we'll get these out to you as soon as we 
can.

Mark"

Kate,
Amerex has a deal on their web checkout traded by Diana on 2/14 where:
Enron buys from Coral 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 2/15-2/16 at $420.00

I do not see this deal in Enpower.  


When I checked out with Amerex on the 14th all deals were confirmed.  When I 
cleared their deals all deals were cleared.
It is our policy to go back and check their web site for additions, changes 
etc. once every week for the week before and this deal popped up.

Can you please check to see if the schedulers received any confirmation of 
flow for this deal from Coral?

Thanks!!

Just wanted to make sure you saw this from Les Rawson concerning Grays Harbor 
and Willamette.
-Bill

Beginning immediately Enron has purchased Control Area Reserves service from 
BPA. 

The allows Services to sell Unit contingent energy as hourly firm since BPA 
is suppling reserves for up to 60 Minutes. If Grays Harbor Paper notifies RT 
of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make 
the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp. For example should Grays 
unit trip as 1333 RT would notify BPA and the sink that across the top of the 
hour for 1400 the schedule would be taken to zero for HE 1400. The bottom 
line is that 60 minutes is the maximum time BPA will carry the schedule.

Send me a e-mail concerning any reductions for Grays since the energy would 
need to be repaid back within 168 hours.

Also, for May Services sold 10 mw of UC energy to EWEB from Willamette all 
hours. As part of this sale Services bought 18 Mw of firm transmission from 
PACW to BPAT for all hours. 10Mw of this purchase will be used for the 
monthly sale with the remaining 8Mw used for day ahead and hourly sales. The 
Assignment Reference # 139990. The cost for this transmission is $2.72 per 
hour vs the $5.84 we normally pay for hourly non-firm so hopefully we can 
save some money on PAC transmission.

Also, beginning May 1 Services purchased Ancillary Services from PacifiCorp 
to allow Willamette's Unit Contingent energy to be sold as 1-hour firm with 
reserves. The procedure for dealing with inner hour cuts is similar to Grays 
with the exception of not calling PAC RT dispatch. Simply cut or reduce the 
schedule at the next ramp and note the derate in a e-mail to Services. This 
service adds .43 cents per Mw to the term sale costs. However, this service 
applies to Willamette's sales up to 30Mw.

Let me know if there are questions.

Les

Dilbert Newsletter 31.0
------------------------


To:     Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)
From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)
Date:   November 2000



   Highlights:
------------------------------------------------
- How I Spent My Summer Vacation
- True Tales of Induhviduals
- Cat Stretching Video
- Dogbert Answers My Mail
------------------------------------------------


DNRC Update
-----------

Many of you have expressed surprise and outrage that Dogbert was
not in the presidential debates.  That's what you think.  What you
don't realize is that Al Gore is actually a robot, remotely
controlled by Dogbert.  The real Al Gore was abducted months ago
and is being held in a safe place.  The strange thing is that the
real Al Gore is a robot too.



How I Spent My Summer Vacation
------------------------------

This newsletter is a bit late because this year I took my first
vacation ever.  It was a cruise to Alaska.  I will summarize it
here so you don't need to go.

Alaska is a large cold place with approximately six residents who
would inbreed if they found each other more attractive.

There was scenery.

Alaska has bald eagles, which are very rare because of Rogaine(tm).

From the cruise ship you can see bears on the shore.  Bears are
about the size of a pencil eraser, at least the ones I saw.  They
might look bigger up close.

If you wondered where all the senior citizens went, they were on my
cruise ship.  That was fine with me; when I'm in bear country I
like to be surrounded by people who can't outrun me.  And it was
fun to see the bald eagles swooping down to our deck and carrying
off the elderly with their majestic talons.  (Why those elderly
people had majestic talons I'll never know.)

The ship had a gym in the bow, with large windows.  When I used the
exercise bike I pretended that the ship was being powered by my
pedaling.  I almost passed out trying to ram a tugboat.  They are
faster than they look.

The cruise ship had something they call a gambling casino.  It
wasn't the kind where you sometimes get back a small portion of
your money.  But that was okay with me because when you're in the
middle of the ocean, and you're not the designated sailor, shoving
money into a small hole in a colorful blinking box can be loads of
fun.

There was food.

If I left anything out, drop by the house and I'll show you the
pictures.


Cat Stretching
--------------

My cat Sarah used to be short and stubby.  Check out my streaming
home video at Lycos Video Center to see how I upgraded her.  Here's
the URL:

http://video.lycos.com/myvideocenter/viewvmail.asp?vm=338035&e=33KUVI9WUjIaU&r
=1


Pillows
-------

Until I obtained good taste, I thought the proper number of pillows
for a bed was one per head.  It's embarrassing to think how wrong I
was.  Thanks to the help of a professional decorator, and Pam, my
bed now has fifteen pillows.  Six of them are big honkers that look
very impressive until they are thrown on the floor at night.  Four
of them are decorative pillows featuring the cheerful faces of
various dogs; those go on the floor at night too. One pillow is a
log-shaped thing called a bolster; it has no purpose that I can
discern.  Two are ""Bucky(tm)"" pillows that support one's neck
should that become necessary on an emergency basis.  When not in
use, they go on the floor with the bolster.

And then there are two pillows that can be used for -- of all
things -- your head. Those stay on the bed.

The bedspread somehow transmogrified into something
Frenchy-sounding, called a duvey or doovay or something like that.
It is so heavy that I put a lump of coal under it and I check its
progress every few days.  You can't actually sleep under it,
especially on warm California nights, but it sure is pretty.  That
goes on the floor too.

Thirteen pillows plus the doovay are strewn around the bedroom
floor all day.  I fantasize about someday making the bed just to
see what it would look like.  Or maybe I'll just spend that same
energy building a full-scale replica of Stonehenge.

I am delighted with my cornucopia of bedding because I know that
should those beautiful items somehow find their way from the floor
to the bed, the sight would make even the most jaded observer step
back and say, ""Wow.  It must be a pain in the ass to have that many
pillows.""



Incompetence Pays
-----------------

A true tale from the field...

My group ordered 14 new workstations for nearly $70,000.  The
contracts person (Induhvidual) responsible for buying the PCs
announced that she was able to negotiate a better price than we had
indicated, saving $14,000 on the purchase.  As a result of the cost
savings, she was granted an award of $7,000, 50% of the cost
savings.  This $7,000 award came out of my group's budget.

When we received the 14 workstations, we discovered how she had
saved the $14,000.  She had removed all the monitors from the
order.  We received 14 computers with no monitors.

We were forced to file a new order for the 14 monitors.  Since the
monitors were not being bought as part of a package, the new price
for the monitors came to $19,000, $5,000 more than our original
order.

The end result was that the $70,000 worth of workstations actually
cost us $82,000, and the Induhvidual was rewarded for her good
work.


Looking Busy
------------

Here's an excellent method for getting paid to do nothing, courtesy
of a devious DNRC member:

Scatter some papers over your desk as though you are working on
them.  Open your middle desk drawer (directly over your lap), place
your favorite magazine in the drawer and spend the next hour
reading it.  Put a pen in one hand and keep that hand in the
drawer.  If someone enters your office, remove the pen from the
drawer and close it in one smooth motion.


Two Dimensional Management
--------------------------

True story: Our senior execs decided they needed to be more
""visible"" to the unwashed masses.  The solution: cardboard cutouts
of the VPs and senior VPs in the break rooms.


Induhviduals Speak
------------------

Here are two recent statements, both from the same Induhvidual, as
recorded by a vigilant DNRC member.

""I'm caught between a rock and a stone.""

""My son has a huge appetite.  He has a bottomless leg.""



Here are some more gems, all uttered by another prolific
Induhvidual.  (I might use some of these myself someday.)


""It's like being a monkey with chickens on your back!""

""Are you too blind to remember?""

""Anyone could go to that person and say, 'I need a bell on the side
of the elephant.'""

""He has too many fingers in the dike.""

""It's like an engineer falling out of a building.""

""Smooth as pie.""

""I have no idea what that is.  Thank goodness we didn't order
three!""

""The active part is there, the proactive is not.""

""Same crap, different fork.""



Lazy Entrepreneur
-----------------

Did you ever have a great business idea but you were too lazy to do
anything about it?  It's frustrating because other people don't
realize how brilliant you are.  To the ignorant observer it appears
you are sitting on your couch drinking soda, burping, and eating
the remnants of potato chips off your shirt.  You look lazy and
dim-witted when in truth you are lazy and brilliant.  It's totally
unfair.

That's why United Media and I created the Lazy Entrepreneur web
site. It's a message board where you can post your brilliant and
generally impractical ideas.  Or make snide remarks about those who
do.  You'll get all the benefits of displaying your brilliance in a
public forum while using no more energy than it takes to type. And
no one will see the embarrassed look on your face when a stranger
tells you your invention has existed for years and you can buy it
at any Target store.

I seeded the Lazy Entrepreneur with a bunch of my own brilliant and
impractical ideas. For example, I'd like to see a prescription pill
container with a built-in manual dial on the bottom, labeled for
each day of the week, so I can use it to remember if I already took
a pill that day.  If the pill has to be taken twice a day, the dial
would have two positions for each day.  If I had a pill container
like that I could stop worrying whether I took my pill and start
worrying whether I remembered to turn the dial.  For some reason,
that seems better to me.

If you don't want to give away your brilliant ideas, the web site
has information on copyrights, patents, trademarks and the like.

DNRC members will get an exclusive preview of the Lazy
Entrepreneur.  It won't be linked from Dilbert.com until next week,
but you can join in the beta test by following the link below.

http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/lazyentrepreneur/

You'll have first choice of user names, and your feedback will have
a big impact on upgrades to the site. (If you find anything that
doesn't work, please send the report to
lazye_bugs@unitedmedia.com).

Wise Crack
----------

In a recent Sunday strip, Wally's co-workers held him down while
Catbert branded him with a hot iron.  An eighth of an inch of
Wally's butt crack was visible in the original drawing.  I was
informed that readers would complain that Wally's butt crack was
destroying the moral fiber of the planet, so we removed the butt
crack line from the print version and included it in the web
version.  This allows us to test the idea that exposure to cartoon
butt cracks is bad for children.  In theory, the kids who see the
unedited web version will grow up to be serial killers, marketing
professionals and auditors.  They might even have butt cracks of
their own, possibly using mirrors to ogle them.  Or they might
become butt crack addicts.  Adult magazines might be printed that
feature nothing but one-eighth inch black lines.

The possibilities are frightening.



True Tales of Induhviduals
--------------------------

Those In-duh-viduals continue to amaze and amuse us.  Here now,
some more true tales as reported by DNRC operatives in the field.

True Tale 1
-----------

My boss handed me ten pages of data and asked me to scan them, use
optical character recognition (OCR) to get them into our
spreadsheet software and rearrange the columns to meet his needs.
After several hours spent scanning and fixing OCR errors, I learned
that the spreadsheets had originally been e-mailed to my boss as an
attachment.  It seems that my boss didn't remember how to rearrange
columns using spreadsheet software so he figured it would be
easiest to print the file and have me do it instead.

True Tale 2
-----------
During my recent attempt to get a pay raise, part of the
conversation went like this:

Me:  ""I have many more responsibilities than I did when I was first
hired, so you should pay me more.""

Pointy-Haired Boss: ""No, because if you weren't here, we'd just do
without the extra functions that you're performing, so why should
we pay you to do them?""

True Tale 3
-----------

I'm the webmaster at my company. I asked the PR director to give me
the most up-to-date list of our business locations so I could
update the web. She downloaded my web pages and gave them to me.

True Tale 4
-----------

I was having trouble getting my boss to read my e-mail.  Upon
investigation he told me he got too many messages and couldn't read
them all.  I investigated further and discovered that he was using
the alphabetical sort feature in Outlook, and since my name started
with a ""P"" he never got down to my e-mails.

True Tale 5
-----------

The following is the real reason dot-coms are burning money.  Our
product development team was meeting with the VP for product
development to unveil our product.  It was fully functional to the
point of beta-testing.  At the conclusion of our presentation, the
VP responded that this was great, since he had been in discussions
with an external IT firm about outsourcing the development.  ""Maybe
we'll be able to get them to do it cheaper if they know we already
have a working product.""

True Tale 6
-----------

A friend told me that his supervisor permitted the receptionist to
make up lost time on a Saturday, when they are closed.

True Tale 7
-----------

This is the real signature line of every mail one of my bosses
sends:

             (Company name) ... Shiting ideas to solutions


I think he meant shiFting.


True Tale 8
-----------

My high school French teacher isn't the sharpest crayon in the box.
She was playing a French song off the Internet, and the class
wanted to know who the band was. She looked at the computer for a
minute, walked to the chalkboard and promptly wrote: MP3.

True Tale 9
-----------

Sometimes, Induhvidualism can work out for the best.

I work at a movie theatre chain that has been sold to another movie
theatre chain.  Technically, everyone in my company is being laid
off.  Per company policy, all employees will be receiving severance
pay before going back to the *exact same* jobs they had before the
switch.

True Tale 10
-----------

An example from our bright travel department:

""Regarding your travel request for Nashville.  You are looking at a
Southwest flight at 1740.  Would this be a.m. or p.m.?""


True Tale 11
-----------

One day on the way to work my wife and I passed by a park and saw
an Induhvidual cleaning up trash in the park using one of those
""garbage harpoons"" and a bucket.

We watched her walk along, picking up garbage and smoking her
cigarette as she went. Just as I started to say how dedicated she
must be for not even stopping her work for a smoke break, she took
the cigarette butt from her mouth and flicked it on the ground and
continued cleaning, leaving the cigarette butt smoldering on the
ground behind her.


True Tale 12
-----------


Here is a wonderful and true story about how the bureaucratic mind
works.

I live in California, and the large building I work in is cooled by
drawing in outside air during the months of June and May. (This
saves lots of money because the huge air conditioner remains off.)

But one June day it was unseasonably hot, so I called the
maintenance department to come and turn on the large roof-mounted
air conditioner.  The following conversation is a jewel.

ME:  It is very hot and uncomfortable in this building.  Will you
please turn on the air conditioning?
 
HER:  Uh, we always leave the air-conditioning off during this
month.

ME:  Yes, I know.  But it is hot outside, and worse inside.

HER:  I am sorry, but this is just part of our yearly program.  We
don't use air conditioning in June.

ME:  But it is getting unbearable in here.

The above exchange was repeated several times, and finally, with
some irritation in her voice, she delivered the following, and hung
up.

HER:  Sir, I am sorry you are uncomfortable over there, but we only
control the air-conditioning; we have no control over the weather!


True Tale 13
-----------

An angry Induhvidual recently accused me of ""cheating"" at our
various work meetings.  I asked how.  The Induhvidual replied that,
""You always prepare for our meetings and that gives you an unfair
advantage.""


Dogbertian Poll
---------------

Dogbert might have inspired this idea.  Someone recently spammed a
bunch of people with a message that asked them to call a 900 number
to vote on the issue of whether spam was a good thing or a bad
thing.  It only cost you $1.50 per minute to complain about spam.



Dogbert Answers My Mail
-----------------------

In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to
answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have
been changed to make them funnier.

Dear Mr. Adams,

I am studying Social Communication in Argentine.  I wonder if you
could send by e-mail all the information about people who work in
offices, the relationship between them and the work environment and
also about office design.

I wish you could send all the information you can get by e-mail
otherwise you can send me a list of bibliography to search
information about the topics in Spanish.

I beg you to answer in a short time, my e-mail.

Romero


Dear Remora,

I'm glad you begged.  People in the United States are too proud to
get right down on all fours and whimper when they want something.
I will send the information you requested right away.  If you don't
see it within a day, call my 900 number and complain.  It is only
$1.50 per minute.

Sincerely,

Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

I THINK YOUR CARTOONS ARE LOUSY,
PLEASE STOP SMOKING THAT DAMN CRACK!

Dear Ahmamouse,

Mr. Adams resents that comment.  He has been known to erase crack
to satisfy editors but he never smokes them.


Sincerely,


Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

My Latin teacher gives us extra credit if we bring in anything that
contains one or more of our 'daily phrases,' such as 'Ad Hoc,'
'Ante Meridian,' and 'Circa.'  I was wondering if you could make me
a cartoon including many Latin phrases that would still be used
today.  This would be a big help.


Abe



Dear Ape,

Latin is what's known as a dead language.  It got that way because
every time a Latin student asked for a special cartoon he was slain
by a hideous monster that lived under his bed.  I'm not saying that
will happen to you, right away.  Anyway, here's a little story that
uses your daily phrases.

My poor Irish ante Meridian was broke.  So she circa the block in
her hometown of Unum until she saw a fish fall from the back of a
fish delivery truck.  It was a carpe worth ten cents.  She thought
that that carpe diem would get her out of hock, or at least reduce
it, but she used so much gas driving in circa that it turned out to
be an ad hoc situation.  So she ate a potato and went to visit her
niece, Pati O'Furniture who lived in the town of Pluri.  She took
the E Pluri Bus from Unum.


Sincerely,


Dogbert




Dilbert Fodder

What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter.  The best comic fodder
involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations of
dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended management
consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Free Seminar: ""Optimization Model for Capital Investment Decisions
Using Option Pricing"", by INFORMS President John Birge

You are invited to attend a free, 45-minute online seminar on
""Optimization model for capital investment decisions using option
pricing"".

When: Wednesday, July 19, at 2:00 PM EDT

Where: Right from your desktop! You can participate using your office
computer and telephone.

How: <http://www.e-optimization.com/resources/web_realoptions.cfm>

Real-option valuation incorporates the opportunities a company may enjoy
using either new knowledge or changes in the marketplace for making
capital investments. The talk focuses on optimization models for
determining best investment levels and demonstrates how stochastic
(involving random variables) programs consider risk without creating
unwieldy formulations. Hear how Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and General
Motors are using this process successfully.

INFORMS President John Birge, Dean of the McCormick School of
Engineering and Applied Science at the Northwestern University in
Illinois, will give the seminar. John is a popular author and speaker
and during the past five years has been in demand for his talks on
stochastic programming and optimization.

Who should attend: OR analysts, strategic planners, financial analysts,
consultants and financial decision makers or anyone interested in
hearing about innovative, exciting, practical decision-making tools.

Subject:        SBX2 78 - Update 

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on 
amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed, 
some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee 
members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by 
TURN and other consumer groups. 

During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and 
Richard Katz from the Governor's office regarding a couple of issues 
highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more 
technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently, 
Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff's request.  D.J. agreed that the bill 
needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA 
contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard about 
it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying 
amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to 
believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too 
self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct 
access.  We suggested that ""shall"" be changed to ""may"" in order to give more 
leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn't necessarily oppose 
the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can 
totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do). 

A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to 
push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this 
bill passes. 

There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor's 
desk. 

The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote on 
additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill. "

Kay,

As I said in my voice mail, please print out executable copies of the CRRA 
LOU with your CKM initial.  We are going to see Bob Wright tomorrow and if he 
has no further changes we can get the documents signed.

Please FedEx them to our attorney's office in Hartford:

We'll be there by 11:00 (enough time to sleep in a little bit), so 10:00 
delivery is perfect.

Also, if you will send the fuel cell document to swanita_99, I will make sure 
I download it and review before seeing Jerry tomorrow night.

Thanks!  Call me on my cell if you need anything.

I'll let you know if anything interesting happens at The Mark Bar or on 
Channel 35 (gotta' love PBS).

Jeff:   As we discussed, ENA Upstream Company, LLC will be trading wellhead 
gas and will need to hedge its risks with Risk Management Trading (""RMT"").   
Accordingly, ENA Upstream needs to enter into a Master Swap Agreement with 
RMT.   This ENA Upstream/RMT Master Swap Agreement will have term and 
conditions similar to the current ENA/RMT Master Swap Agreement.   Would you 
please have someone in your group draft the ENA Upstream/RMT Master Swap 
Agreement.   ENA Upstream has begun trading and needs to be this agreement in 
place as soon as conveniently possible.   Please let me know if you have 
questions or need additional information.   Thanks, John.

Dear PeeWee Baseball '02 Player:

It's hard to believe that the 2002 SBMSA Baseball season is just around
the corner, but it is!  This year's Skills Evaluations for Westchester
PeeWees (3rd and 4th grades) will be held at the Spring Forest fields on
Saturday and Sunday, February 2nd and 3rd.  More information on this
will be telephoned to each player early next week that will detail the
exact time to show-up.  For those of us, however, that are in need of a
little ""warm-up"" before the evaluations, informal batting practice
(machine) and fielding drills will be going on next Wednesday and
Thursday (Jan 30 and 31st) at the Spring Forest fields from 6 - 8 pm.
To participate, come by either day (or both) with your glove, bat and
batting helmet.

See you next week,

David Benninger
Westchester PeeWee Commissioner

Attached is a redline against the present Take Over LD section of Rev 5 of GE 
world hunger.   I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They 
are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within 
their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW 
with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads.

I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works.  I have left it there to 
see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work.  I am trying to get GE on 
the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for 
Completion.  We did not do that in Arcos since GE's time in theory is the 
same as the contractors.


Probably merits an internal discussion before sharing with GE.

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or

Over the next several months Enron will be phasing in a new expense-reporti=

Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless=20
process.  In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP=20
accounting system. =20

On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded t=

p=20
employees, Company 0011.  The rollout to other groups will continue through=

January 2001.  Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit.=20

In Houston, IT Central will provide four training sessions per week. To=20

Gentlemen:

Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB.  
It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.  

It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me 
otherwise.  I'll get back to you with the location.

Greetings:

Are we supposed to do the reading and the Oracle and Legal Services cases
for Thursday?  Syllabus says yes, but I gather from Tasker's Izio not that
we'll be in the computer center all class doing modeling.  (I'd email her,
but she doesn't get my emails apparently.)  Anyone have a clue?

Best,
Jeff

We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
carefully....

SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW
 Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak
 Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak

NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW
 Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak
 Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak

If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
him to do the same.

Thanks,
Kate"

Yeah, just think of the lines we could use:

Hey baby, wanna come out and help me pitch my tent?
Your sleeping bag or mine?
Hey baby, lets go camping.  I'll supply the pork and beans.

As we have done with El Paso, Aquila and Duke; is it possible for us (Tax) to 
speak directly to the LG&E Tax Professionals.  We have found this to be the 
most efficient and effective means of handling the tax issues.  Please advise.

Thanks.

Cheryl,

I have reviewed the current contracts and deals in place with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. (CP ID 55358) and found that we have deals extending through 08/31/01.  However, the only current deals are with ICC Energy Corporation (an alternate payee under our contract with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. ).  There are NO current deals with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. at this time.

We currently have two master contracts in place as well as two spot GTCs.  I imagine that we will need to terminate all these agreements, but Legal is unaware of any changes with this counterparty.  Darren, can you please provide Stacy Dickson with the name of your contact at Constellation?  

We also do not have ANY master agreements in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc. - all business (telephonic and EOL) is being covered under GTCs.  Stacy or Debra, do we have any negotiations in place for a master under this name?  Darren, can you work with Stacy on this?

Please let me know if we need to terminate or trade suspend the Constellation Energy Source, Inc. agreements.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Cheryl,

Please do not suspend this CP until my group can review the current contracts in place and any deals that may have been covered by those contracts.  Bridgette Anderson will be looking at this once trading slows tomorrow.  We'll discuss it and get back with you tomorrow afternoon.

Has anyone in Legal heard anything on this?  

Thanks,

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

I just noticed one minor error.  I think that you are trying to highlight 
that Terry Winter, the Chief Executive Officer of the ISO voted against the 
proposal.  In the text, you say the Chairman of the ISO.  There is no 
Chairman of the ISO.  There is a Chairman of the Board of the ISO -- Jan 
Smutney-Jones -- who has consistently voted against the price caps since 
June.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

Dear Shirley
?
Further to our telephone conversation earlier  today, I am writing concerning 
the GARP 2001 Convention, which will be held in  New York between 13th and 
14th February.
?
I have set a new deadline for presentations to be  sent to me, which is 
Friday 5th January. I am sure you can appreciate that  collating, arranging, 
organising and printing over 80 presentations is a mammoth  logistical task, 
hence why I require the presentations as soon as  possible.
?
Can I please have an indication of when I am likely  to receive Vince's 
presentation? Below is the talk he has agreed to give (he has  also agreed to 
chair the stream on Energy & Corporate Risk on Tuesday 13th  February):
?
Measuring Energy Risk -  Tackling Price Volatility, Adapting VaR, Scenario 
Modeling and Regulatory  Requirements
- mean (or floor)  reversion

Vince,

Two items.  Unless you have an objection, I plan to ship the paper on to
Don Chew at the journal this morning.  We can still work on the article but
he needs something to begin the editing process.

Second, in the same issue as our paper will appear the transcript of a
roundtable discussion involving Sheridan titman, John McCormack (Stern
stewart), Ron Erd (Southern Energy), Jeff Sandifer (president of sandifer
capital--$700 million undermanagement), and Gene Humphries.  Attached you
will find a section THAT WILL NOT BE IN THE FINAL DOCUMENT, but that I
thought you might like to read in light of our own discussions over the
course of writing this paper.

Have a great day.

The attached is a pretty decent summary of the recent U.S. Supreme Court's 
opinion on the Clean Water Act's juridictional reach to isolated waters.   
Thought it might be of interest to origination/developer type lawyers.

		 Subject: Analysis of the Supreme Court's January 9, 2001 SWANCC Decision


Attached is a brief memo prepared by Van Ness Feldman analyzing the U.S. 
Supreme Court's January 9, 2001 decision in the case of Solid Waste Agency of 
Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (No. 99-1178 (U.S. 
January 9, 2001)).  By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court determined that ""isolated"" 
waters (often wetlands) are not subject to regulation under the Clean Water 
Act (and the Section 404 permitting program).  This decision has significant 
implications for anyone who is, or will be engaging in the construction of 
generating facilities, transmission lines, factories, houses, pipelines, or 
similar projects.

Van Ness Feldman will be providing our friends and clients with periodic 
updates on breaking legal and legislative activity throughout the remainder 
of 2001.  If you would like to be removed from this distribution list, please 
respond to this e-mail and let us know.

Master Netting Group:

I just want to personally thank all of you for all of your hard work the past few weeks in addressing our counterparties' requests for Master Netting Agreements.  We have been able to sign up a number of them as a result of your efforts and have managed to keep certain counterparties from cutting us off in trading.  	Thanks again for your efforts and for putting up with one fire drill after another!  Hopefully we all learned alot in the process.

Elizabeth, 
Carol and I had a  conversation (with Justin Boose mostly listening in) about 
how best to coordinate her much welcomed support for West Desk EEI deals and 
out of that conversation I would like to propose that we send the following 
message to Tim and the Mid-Marketers.  The message is designed to enforce a 
kind of teamwork discipline and approach to EEI work that Steve, Justin and 
me have been developing here.  Obviously the message will not be sent until 
you and Carol are happy with it, and my suggestion is that you, Elizabeth, 
should send the message.  

Mid-Marketers:
The legal team supporting West Desk Trading has been strengthened by the 
addition of Carol St. Clair of ENA's Houston legal department.  Carol is 
going to concentrate on negotiating high priority EEI Agreements.  We are 
trying to build an improved process  for supporting EEI negotiations that 
involves a teamwork approach among a team of lawyers working together  along 
the following lines.  The idea is to create a steady processing of all EEI 
agreements at one level,  while at the same time,  having the flexibility to 
keep our most experienced trading attorneys working on our highest EEI 
priorities at any given time. The highest priority EEI agreements will be 
those where we are trying to get new, long term business. 

Justin Boose of Stoel Rives will have the responsibility to drive Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 of the EEI process. 

Stage 1 is all internal steps required to send a Cover Sheet including credit 
terms to the Counterparty.  These steps will involve getting the credit work 
sheet from Credit to our paralegal, Genia Fitzgerald and getting the Cover 
Sheet including the credit terms from Genia, proofreading it and identifying 
who to send it to.  

Stage 2 is harassing the Counterparty and, in cooperation with Mid-Marketers, 
getting the right people from the CP  to look at our Cover Sheet and reply 
with comments.  

Christian and Carol will be primarily responsible for Stage 3 of the EEI 
process, with Steve Hall also involved in this stage from time to time as 
other priorities may permit.  

Stage 3 is driving  the negotiations from the completion of Stage 2 to 
closing. 

Pat Boyston will be asked to join Stage 3 to help address all muni issues and 
to close out other issues as well from time to time.  Eventually Justin will 
grow into providing Stage 3 support. 

The critical credit liaison function will be made by the responsible attorney 
as the process moves to completion, with Legal taking the responsibility to 
drive the overall process to completion. 

We believe this kind of disciplined approach by this team should provide an 
enhanced level of support for EEI negotiations day in and day out if 
everybody recognizes   who is expected to do what during the three Stages. 
Christian has the responsibility to see that either he or Carol or Steve are 
concentrating on the highest priority EEI negotiations at any given time. 

Support for EEI negotiations is only part of the legal work that must be done 
for the West Desk and prioritizing the other work will be handled by 
Christian and Steve, working with me in Houston.  ----E. Sager.

QC3611.1
QC4110.1
QC4394.1

Can you please also go through this book to see if there are any more deals

aren't the person who handles this book, and please forward this message on

Thanks for your help

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Thanks.

The file sent out yesterday had several inconsistencies that were brought to 
my attention by Cynthia and Terry. 
The corrected billing is attached. I regret any inconvenience this may have 
caused.


Please note: 
A changed from previous billing file... USGT was charged 3 cents/d for stored 
quantities(The quantities stored from 7/25 -7/31 did not trigger the tiered 
rates). 
The daily rate was suspended  for gas day 7/01 thru 7/09 for both Duke Energy 
and Sempra due to the station 4 compressor outage.  Invoice amounts for these 
shippers reflect this adjustment.
Reliant (PO 27060) carryover quantity of 1,514 MMBtu from previous month - 
$1,362.60 (This qty remains from April business)
Sempra (PO 27255) carryover quantity of 6,000 MMBtu from previous mpnth - 
$5220.00 ( This qty was parked in June)

If you have any questions, please call me at  x36486.

Paul,
Actually, we are interested in a straight monthly puts -- probably 25 MWs per month -- on our NYMEX position (i.e., at the money monthly strikes with put premium for year paid within first 3 business days after 1/1/2002.

Curt,

Are you interested in doing a similar structure for your NYMEX index
positions?  We can incorporate the unit contingent component into the
deal with how we did handled it in our previous transaction and also
enhance it by paying you the difference between DJ index and NYMEX for
when Bonanza goes down since you may be concerned that the NYMEX price
you are receiving will not match the market prices that you may have to
pay to replace the energy.  Give me a call to discuss this and I am
getting the ball rolling on getting you a copy of the ISDA.

Best Regards,

Paul Choi

Chris,
I have asked our team to review the document you sent me and to ascertain
what the hold up is. One thing that has been made clear to me is that we
were ready to begin testing a month ago and had to idle a group of folks
while your development team caught up. This has created a bit of a manpower
crunch for us but we will fix it. I will respond to you when I know more. I
am out of the office next two days but available on Thursday and Friday.

Don, per your request attached is the model I created to value the 
transaction.  This model was created utilizing the Origination/Structuring 
model as a starting point.  I have used EPMI/ENA's power and fuel curves as 
opposed to the company's base case pricing scenario.  I have also used a 
mortgage style debt amortization based on $118MM of funded debt.  Attached is 
a memo that touches on the transaction, the value of the price risk 
management contracts, financial results, and some closing comments.  

Regards,

Christopher

Stephanie - I question whether your buy-out idea would fly.  The major thing that got the CPUC in the settlement was the recall rights of Block II which assured that the former PG&E customers would always have firm rights to cheap gas - at least for the term of the settlement.  Removing them would require a tariff change, and I can't see the CPUC agreeing.

Subject:	Turnback of EPNG Capacity
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

I have had several conversations with EPNG about the possibility of ENA turning back capacity to satisfy 1) requests for new capacity in the Power Up 2000 project and 2) any possible capacity that EPNG may need to provide to satisfy incremental needs of full requirements customers as they convert billing determinants to Contract Demand quantities.

In order to preserve our position, should I send a formal letter to Al Clark stating our desire to turn the capacity back? The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.

We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.

Leslie - could you help me with the letter?

Many thanks!

Sent:=09Tuesday, October 09, 2001 11:04 PM
To:=09All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:=09Security Update


Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=

sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=

 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=

I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.  The 
automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of 
time; especially during bidweek.  I know there are others who deserve thanks 
in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as 
well.  I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.  When do you think 
we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg?  
Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?  Thanks again.

Rick,

I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. 

For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:

Average tenor: 5 months

Average trades per day: 400

average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu

average px: $2.7/mmbtu

With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7

You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.

That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).

The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.

As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?

Andy

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Mary,

I'm sending this on Kim's behalf since her Outlook is overloaded.  Please see attached schedules for Operations and OSS.  We have not reduced our expenses from Plan at this point.  With the reorganization, we are not comfortable reducing our costs until we have completed a thorough analysis.

  

If you have any questions, please call Kim or me.

Below is the revised version of the Crude Oil Agreement, with changes from
the one you probably saw this morning.  Alan Aronowitz thought (and I
concur) that since we don't really have liquidated damages we should take
that language out of the last section.

I'll send the proposed Gas Agreement, marked from the Oil one, shortly.

I think Lima would make a great bobble head.  You better get there early.

I received an email from Alfons telling me he was resigning from Technip.  
I'm clueless why he sent it to me.  Talked to Gerry last week.  He says he is 
going to put his Kingwood house on the market.  Hmm.  I hear lots of the old 
gang is working with him now.

Have you gone to your reunion yet?  How was it?

Gotta go home but I didn't want to not write back today.  Hope you find all 
your Easter eggs.

Thanks for hosting, Kim.  Jackie mentioned the list of tasks that remain to
get this done (e.g., graphs, make spreadsheet pretty, write-up, etc.).
I'lll do whatever needs to be done, so once folks have picked which task
they'd like to take on, just let me know what's left.  Or if there's
another way folks would like to divvy up the chores, that's great, too.
Have a great weekend.  See you Monday.

Jackie, could you email the latest version around when you get a chance?
Thanks.

Best,

	We are continuing to identify and review potentially responsive
documents within California called for by the subpoena issued by Dunn's
Committee to Enron Corp and by the California AG's subpoenas to Enron Energy
Services. Peter Meringolo and Amanda Smith are leading this effort at our
office. This is our report on the status of this document identification and
our plans, subject to your direction,  to continue this effort next week.
The last section of the memo poses certain logistical questions and issues
regarding the production to  Dunn's Committee that Mike Kirby should
address as soon as possible.
I. Status of EES' Response to Subpoena from AG
As we previously reported, we have completed a preliminary investigation of
documents in the EES's offices in California which are responsive to the
subpoena from the attorney general.  Below is a report of (1) documents
collected (2) documents we need to collect soon; and (3) action items which
we still need to do in order to identify responsive documents.
		A.	Documents Collected
We have copies of the following documents:
*	Contracts from the San Ramon office
*	Contracts and documents relating to the contracts from Costa Mesa
office
		B.	Documents to Collect
We previously identified the following relevant documents.  However, we have
not yet collected them into one central location:
*	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities.
These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled ""California
Rapid Response"" and ""California Strike Force"" and email.
*	""Golden Bear"" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach
*	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E).
Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein.
*	Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities.
These documents are on Mojgan Ahad's hard drive in files labeled ""California
Rapid Response"" and ""California Strike Force"" and email.
*	""Golden Bear"" documents in San Ramon, Costa Mesa and Long Beach
*	Files related to status of EDI's (re: return of customers to PG&E).
Presently kept by Summer Intern, Kerri Bernstein.
*	Documents ""related to"" each contract in the possession of each
account manager in San Ramon
*	Current and Old Organization charts
		C.	Action Items
To complete our review of the relevant documents in California, we plan to
do the following:
*	Review emails and hard drives of Tom Riley, Dirk van Ulden, Mojgan
Ahad, and Jim Wright
*	Interview, and review documents in the possession of, ""Originators""
in Long Beach


II. Status of Enron Corporation's Response to Subpoena from Senator Dunn
We are prepared to produce more than 30,000 pages of documents to the
Sacramento repository on Monday in response to the subpoena from Senator
Dunn.  This memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved before
Enron's production of documents in California is complete.
This memorandum is divided into three sections:  (1) substantive issues to
be resolved; (2) documents remaining to be reviewed, and (3) logistical
issues to be addressed by Mike Kirby.
		A.	Substantive Issues
We have prepared and sent to Mike Kirby and Richard Sanders and others a
packet of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible.  We need
guidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents.  These
documents include:
*	Bids made to DWR & ISO.  The subpoena calls for bids made to the ISO
and PX, and we assume that this means ""bid data.""  However, Enron did submit
bids to provide for Summer Reliability Generation and to provide energy to
the DWR.  Should we produce these documents?
*	Enron Business Plans.  These documents talk in general terms about
strategies for developing revenue in California - not necessarily forecasts
of revenue.  These documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked for
by the subpoena.  Siting/ Generation Development documents.  This is a broad
category of documents which are irrelevant to the Senate investigation.
However, if the subpoena is broadly (and perhaps fairly) read, many
documents within this category may be responsive.  Our suggestion is to
carve out these documents, and let the Senate Committee know that we are
doing so.  For example:
		.Dunn asks for information about generation units owned or
controlled by Enron.  We found documents in which Enron ""controlled"" the
development of the unit, but then sold it to a third party.  Likewise, Enron
is involved in a project to expand Las Vegas Co-Gen facility.
		.Many of these documents contain financial data, such as
supply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to go
forward with the project.
		.We have numerous proposal and drafts, but not finalized
deals, in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy the
energy from the facility.  These drafts are not called for by the subpoena,
but documents related to final contracts are.
		.We have gathered documents related to negotiations with QFs
to serve as Scheduling Coordinators, which apparently coincide with
divestiture by the utilities.
*	Documents related to meetings of the Independent Energy Producers
(""IEP"") trade association.  These documents clearly are responsive.  Many,
however, contain sensitive and privilege information, including information
about lobbying efforts.  Thus, we need to provide notice to the IEP that we
are required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity to
review these documents before we produce them.  Additionally, we should
contact their counsel to see what, if anything, has already been produced (I
assume that they have been subpoenaed).
*	B.	Enron Corp Documents in San Francisco yet to be Reviewed
We have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materials
maintained in the San Francisco office.  We will complete this review next
week, and produce any additional documents to the repository.  The following
is a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed:
*	Electronic documents on Sue Mara's hard drive
*	Email messages maintained by Dave Parquet, Mike McDonald, and Sue
Mara
*	Interview Mike McDonald
*	Review addition materials relating to QF's recently located by
Enron.
*	C. Logistical Issues and Questions for Mike Kirby
*	Delivering boxes to Sacramento repository
We need someone to drive the boxes to Sacramento and obtain a key for the
repository space.  Bob Webb, a senior paralegal, has ""volunteered"" if we
need him to go.
*	Staffing the Sacramento repository
 We assume that we will need a proctor when the Senate Committee reviews the
documents.   Can we work out a schedule or protocol with them?  Moreover, we
will need to have someone drive to Sacramento each time we produce
documents.  We cannot simply federal express or messenger the documents
because there is no one to receive them.
*	Confidential Stamping
We have not marked anything ""Confidential.""  Should we do that now, or
should we wait until the Senate selects documents for copying?
*	Privilege Log
We will begin creating a privilege log next week.  When do we need to have
it completed?

Subject: Korea: Regulatory Impediment to Bandwidth Trading / Action Plan

Our regulatory review team in Korea this week has identified a major 
regulatory 
 impediment to bandwidth trading in Korea.   This describes the problem and 
 outlines a draft strategy to deal with it, with actions shown in blue. 

Problem:  

It appears that under the Telecommunications Business Law (as interpreted by 
the 
Korea Communications Commission in a recent ruling against MCI), a Specific 
Services
Provider Type 1 (which we want to be) cannot resell International Private 
Leased Circuits
wholesale.   Only a Facilities Based provider (Network Services Provider) can 
do resale of 
International Leased Lines under the current law.  We do not want to be a 
Network Services Provider because an NSP can not exceed 49% foreign ownership 
and has immense responsibilities. 

Factual Background:

We want to be a specific services provider Type 1 (reseller with facilities 
such 
as servers and switches).  Under the law as interpreted in the recent ruling, 
however, SSPs:

    -  can buy or lease international lines only from NSPs.   
    -  cannot sell International Private Leased Circuits to other SSPs, 
         to Value-Added Service Providers (VSPs), or to ISPs.  
    -  can sell international capacity only to end users, not to other 
wholesalers. 

The recent ruling came about when MCI (not a Network Service Provider) leased 
international lines from an NSP in Korea and resold them to Goldman Sachs for 
traffic
to Hong Kong.    Korea Telecom brought  a case against MCI to the Korea 
Communications
Council (KCC) for decision.   Kim and Chang, our Enron energy lawyers in 
Korea, handled
the case (they did not disclose to us that MCI was the client).  

The KCC ruled  for KT and against MCI.   I'm not sure yet why Goldman Sachs 
was 
treated as a wholesaler and not an end user which should have been legal.  At 
this point, however,
the situation is that if a foreign company tried to resell IPLCs wholesale, 
any local NSP could bring a 
complaint to the KCC,  and would run the regulatory risk of being forced to 
cease. 
(The sources for this conclusion are Kim and Chang, the Ministry of Info and 
Communications,
and the Korea Information Society Institute, a telecom policy think tank for 
the Ministry.)

Options: 

(1)  Change the law.   A revision of the law is drafted but does not fix this 
and changes
      are closed for this year.  Amendments on the floor of Parliament are 
impossible in Korea.
      For a change in law, we would have to try in summer 2001 to get a 
change in early 2002.    
      Change by Presidential Decree is also possible but is overkill.   Not 
feasible.

(2)  Get a new interpretation from the Korea Communications Council that says 
what we 
       plan to do in Korea in bandwidth is OK.   

             We would ask Kim and Chang to present our proposed plans to the 
KCC 
             before we enter the bandwidth trading (BWT) market.  We would 
describe
             it in a way that is sufficiently different from the MCI case.   
Jae Moo made 
             this suggestion. 
 
              Pro:  If we get a favorable ruling we are in business.  We do 
not have money
                      at risk unless the regulatory road is clear.  

              Con:  an unfavorable ruling slams the door specifically on us.

              Recommended Steps:               

                    (1)   We should explore this option with Kim and Chang.  
                 
                    Robbi or Michelle:  if you agree, please contact Kim and 
Chang to discuss this
                    and authorize start of this work if they agree with this 
approach.   I will work with 
                    you to develop the scope of work and can operate with Kim 
and Chang during the
                    work as necessary. 

                    (2)  We will contact MCI to get more facts on their case 
including whether
                    they were selling to a wholesaler who sold to Goldman or 
directly to Goldman.
                    We can say the Ministry mentioned their case.  We should 
probably not be thinking
                    about joint action with MCI at this point as we want to 
say our case is different if we 
                    can.   I will explore facts with an MCI contact in Tokyo 
and Craig will do same
                    in Singapore.
               
(3)  Redefine where a sale of IPLCs takes place to have it not be in Korea.  
Would
      need legal/commercial creative analysis.   Possible but uncertain 
option.  

(4)  Redefine the product so as not to be a re-sale:   If we buy capacity and 
chop it up
      into smaller pieces or alter it before we sell it, maybe we are not 
re-selling what we 
      bought.  But we may still have a problem if the new product is sold to 
wholesalers.

               Let's explore 3 and 4 above and similar ideas in a conference 
call.
               Robbi, can you set up a call on this with me, Donald, 
you/Michelle,
               Wayne Gardner, Craig Clark, Roger Estrada, Xi Xi ?
           
(5)  Partner/j-v with a local firm already having the NSP status such as KT,
      SK Telecom, Dacom, etc., or become an NSP.  49% foreign ownership 
restirction.  
      Huge regulatory filing.    Not feasible. 


Parallel Actions:

(1 ) Take issue up with US Trade Representative (telecom) in DC (Jonathan 
McHale).
      Also work with local Amcham telecom committee and US Embassy.
      
               We should do this in parallel with whatever option we choose.  
I will work on this
               with Steve Burns in DC when we are farther along.  

 (2) Work to  promote understanding of the merits of BWT for Korea/elsewhere.

               BWT was never contemplated in the laws and regulations. All our
               contacts said BWT needed to be explained more widely in Korea 
to gain
               support.   It is new even to the telecom think tanks.   We 
need to do
               missionary work on this to develop public opinion.   We need 
to find 
               a noted PhD economist who is a great communicator who can 
speak to the 
               think tanks in Korea, Singapore, Japan, etc. and give 
interviews on 
               the merits of BWT for efficiency, promoting investment, etc.  
This will
               create the climate for regulators to change.  I have one 
possibility in mind
               but suggestions of names welcome.  I will propose this 
separately to 
               Anthony later.

Elaine,
I spoke with Pam Daily;  she said that due to all the recent moves & changes, it would probably be December before rent charges hit the cost centers directly, and that there would not be any 2001 true-ups.
Hope this answers your question.
Thanks, 
Nancy

Here is your latest roster. We are up-to-date on all changes but, of
course, the students may still drop/add up to the second week of module 5.
When the time comes, please check your roster carefully and make sure that
the people on the list really are attending your course. Mistakes happen so
I just would like to make sure we have a correct record.

As always, let me know if you would like the excel folder with e-mail
addresses. I don't send them at the same time to avoid overwhelming our
e-mail system. Thanks for your help!

After reviewing heir form of Guaranty, I would prefer that we use our

they insist on using our form , I would be happy to mark it up but the 
mark-up would be fairly substantial.  Let me know what you want to do.

Subject: MG Middle Office Integration Issues and timetable

To all

Tim has delivered the initial microsoft project plan for the MO integration - 
this is available to all via the integration project 'office' - i.e. Richard 
and Phil.

I summarise the key themes as :-

summary operational risk assessment across all MG entities and functional 
groups ( as defined within the DPR )
defining MO organisational structure and fit with Enron's control model - 
particularly logistics and co-ordination
interaction with Fin Ops processes
month end consolidation process
SAP implementation
working capital and revenue forecasting
interaction with RAC re VAR / trading limits ( market and credit )
awaiting notice of trading limits
credit counterparty review and set up within GCP
VAR methodology implementation
interaction with IT re systems development/maintenance
AS 400 development timetable and roll out to NY for WANG replacement
MITS/EOL migration
Use of Enlighten in application architecture
defined IT resource requirement
interaction with Legal re Enron Metals name change and related documentation 
issues
MO integration planning for settlements and trade accounting

The focus and objectives relating to the above for this week are as follows :-

review of London processes and define boundaries for segregation of duties 
implementation ( Action TPP ) - also discuss extension to NY ( SWilson )
review of Wolff activities in Germany ( Action KR/AC )
continuing review of new recycling yards ( project Cook ) in Germany ( Action 
AH/RJ )
review interdependencies between MO/Fin Ops/RAC/Systems integration plans ( 
Action MJ/RS )
document current assessment of operational risk with particular emphasis on 
Wolff and Recycling businesses ( Action MJ with KR/AC/AH/RJ/TPP/SW )
Brainstorm month end accounting close and potential earnings election for 
consolidation ( Action  TPP/MJ/BA/SWood )

Dear Navroz

Thanks for getting back to me.  The reason there has been a dialogue (not, I 
should point out, with Nick, but with Shan Millie), is that my work is of 
quite a large size, and needs to find an appropriate home.  The question is 
should it go into a compilation book, or somehow be published in the 
magazine?  I was awaiting some feedback from Risk on the best course of 
action.

We were hoping to publish a cut down version in the magazine, and a full 
version in Risk's upcoming ""Game Choices"" book, but I've heard nothing from 
your organisation until now (and I fear we've now missed the boat on the Game 
Choices book deadline).   I'm attaching the full internal Enron document for 
your reference, and I'd appreciate your thoughts on how best to put the 
article in your journal.  Since the subject is highly diagrammatic, I'm 
concerned that 4000 words may be too many when coupled with diagrams!  (It is 
currently only 6000 words, but is around 25 A4 pages long.)  If you can give 
me some guidance on the issue of publishing extensive diagrams as part of the 
text, I'll get to work chopping my work around until it suits your preferred 
format.

Shan Millie gave me some good feedback on general points of style and clarity 
in my writing, but incorporating these would actually make the article longer 
rather than shorter.  I think you'd better look the document over before I do 
further work on it.

I look forward to your response.

Many thanks,
Steve Leppard

Not having received the request,  it seems like the quantity related to the 
contract would provide them better info than a contact name and phone 
number-  did they specifically ask for that inf0??  upon answer, work 
directly with Drew as I'll be out.   MK

In response to a request of Steve January from FERC, I've put together a list 
of Transwestern's ""major"" shippers to California with contact names and phone 
numbers.  I've defined ""major"" as anyone with total firm contracts of 
25,000/d or more.  Please see the attached list.  Is everyone okay with me 
passing this along to Ray Montini at FERC?

Let me know if it's okay to go or if I need to run this by anyone else before 
sending it out.

Thanks,
Lindy

It was good to see you again this week.  I talked with Wayne Sanders and Tom
Falk, and we would very much like to get together with you for a meeting in
Dallas possibly in December.  Wayne asked that we include Jeffrey Skilling.
I have asked Jeanine Jankowski, my assistant, to help arrange the meeting in
Dallas.  Jeanine will be contacting your assistant.

There apparently was a proposal made at the last VP PRC Committee meeting to retitle the Commercial Support peer group to ""Professional Services"" (see note below).  Let me know if you are opposed to this, otherwise I will indicate ETS' support for this change later this week.

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

All,

The following are highlights of today's Integration Team meeting:

All areas are on track for a successful legal closing of 2/8/02 and
1st day trading of 2/11/02.

Canada:  Three open issues.
	Parent Guarantee
	Some legal entity issues
	Capital/funding requirements

A work plan is in place for all three issues, but may not be
completed by 2/11/02. Worst case, only a few days delay in start
trading. This has NO IMPACT on day one trading in the U.S.

United States:  No ""show stoppers"" in U.S to prevent Legal Close or
First Day Trading.  Open issues are:

	Legal:  Status Green. Clients must have a Master Agreement or
Adoption Agreement or General terms and Conditions (GTC) in place
before trading can commence.  Getting agreements in place is slow
process (2 weeks to 2 months).  Legal and Credit Risk are working
hard to approve as many clients as possible from ""Energy LLC""
approved list of 166. This impacts the number of clients that can
trade on day one.  Business expectations have been set for day one.

	Business:  Status Green.  No additional issues/concerns from
Louise Kitchen, COO, UBS Warburg Energy LLC.  No additional issues
from CFI, or Pat O'Donnel.

	Credit Risk:  Status Green.  For Day one, traders will not have
access to credit information. Credit Risk will distribute list of
approved clients to traders and traders will have to call for credit
approval.

	Mkt. Risk:  Status Green.  Walter Stuerzinger needs to approve
VAR models.  2/7/02 EBK briefing on VAR is important.

	FCD:  Status Green.  Some open issues surrounding SEC
requirements but they are being addressed.  An expedited approval
process will be used to resolve Day one exposure issues if they occur.

	Operations:  Status green.  Lead-time for templates used for
counterparty approvals is 24 hours.  Lead-time for confirmation
templates is 48 hours.  Impact: ""don't make lead-time, don't trade
with this client"".  IR/Derivative settlement process not ready yet,
but being worked by Ops/Credit.

	Corp Comm:  Status Green.  WEB site ""look and feel"" and contents
complete. Need sign off by legal/business (louise Kitchen).  Day one
communications to clients/employees ready.

There will be a conference call on Thurs February 7th at 10:00 EST
where the
""Go""/ ""No-Go"" decision will be made for the Day 0 ""Legal Closing"".
Dial in 19-337-0070, PIN 553815

There will be a conf call on Friday, February 8th, at 10:00 EST,
where the
""Go""/ ""No-Go"" decision will be made for the Day 1 ""Commercial
Integration""
on Monday, February, 11th.  Same dial in number/pin


Thanks,
Mark

True, but the limits and associated P&L notifications relate to commodity 
groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, 
where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately 
hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and 
associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity ""cut"".

Loss notifications, especially, serve as a ""flag"", and provided the 
explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, 
can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, 
sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good 
""institutional memory"".

I talked to Brent about this yesterday - my advice was that notifications 
would be better drafted by those closest to the positions (i.e. his mid 
office groups)

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat

It probably makes sense to circle up on this on Monday and also to discuss a call that I received from Randy.  He indicated that we should probably sit down with Bridgeline to discuss the likelihood of acceptance/rejection of the storage/transport deal in order to potentially figure out what is most beneficial for both parties.

I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.

Subject:	Bridgeline Meeting and the First of my 10 daily emails

I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval process will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns #13/#14 to Bridgeline.  I will send you via fax the proposed deal sheet.

Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is the last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Lease - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligated to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following the 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right around 4/4/02. 

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all claims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease; This approach sounds reasonable. 

3)  Bridgeline indicated that Dow is of the opinion that approximately $167k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt removed fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leaching operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify their numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during degassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to understand their basis for the claim.  

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various rights-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know what the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to wrap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with ownership of the cavern. 

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximately 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agreeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be done no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable. 

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $550k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.

ss Rights



My apologies to those of you who received the March 20 version.  Here is the
final version mentioned in the note below.




Attached for you review and support is the final Capacity Issues Settlement
in the Gas Industry Restructuring/Natural Gas Proceeding.  In addition, we
have included a revised version of Appendix A, the primary and secondary
receipt point access rights statement.

The attached documents are the result of countless hours of negotiation on
behalf of the parties supporting this document.  I would like to
congratulate all of the active parties for their patience and flexibility
throughout this process.  Because we are under an April 3 filing deadline,
we need to finalize support for this proposal no later than COB Friday,
March 31.  Please forward your support of this proposal to Lad Lorenz (213
244-3820) or Brian Cherry (213 244-3895) as soon as possible.

We are also finalizing the Retail Issues Settlement with those parties
interested in this matter and expect to circulate a formal document tomorrow
morning.  I ask for your continuing patience.

Once again, I would like to thank everyone for the Herculean efforts they
have made to make this settlement possible.

With Teri's departure, Grace Rodriguez will begin to assist me and Rick 
Johnson on HR related matters.  She will also continue to support the 
Technical Analysis group until a suitable replacement has been identified.  
In the meantime, Grace will be supported by Elizabeth Squires to assist with 
ad hoc duties.

Please join me in congratulating Grace on her new responsibilities.

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:

The NYPSC today issued an Order directing the expedited consideration of  
""bottoms-up"" rate unbundling by all of the state's major electric and gas 
utilities. Enron has long pushed the PSC to address this issue. The PSC wants 
unbundled rates in effect by the first half of 2002, and has set up a 
two-stage process to get there. Under the first stage, which the PSC wants 
completed and brought to them for decision by this August, major policy 
issues of statewide import  are to be considered. Resolution of these issues 
will guide the actual embedded cost studies which each of the utilities are 
directed to perform. These cost studies and the fully unbundled rates that 
will flow from them, will then be reviewed in utility-specific cases. The PSC 
expects the studies to be completed before the end of this year.  I 
anticipate that we will actively participate in this proceeding, which is 
actually being spun off from the ""end-state"" proceeding, through our NESPA 
coalition. A copy of the PSC's order should be available on their website:

Subject: Updated CES Jun'00 FOM Requirements


The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled ""Comments"".   The only changes
versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

I might become a little more organized. Do you think we might be able to

I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen =
that 10 point I shot ""on the hoof"", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out low=
er jaw for inspection, you would have said ""Damn, that's an old deer.""=20
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler form=
ation (9"" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2=
, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had=
 about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass w=
as more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by=
 side, the younger one looked like a ""thoroughbread Horse"", while mine look=
ed like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think t=
hat we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria tog=
ether about what ""formula"" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say t=
hat My 10 point was ""Mature and on his way down"" while the young one (Same =
deer that Keith has seen, too) is ""Mature and on his way up"". The last thin=
g I have to say about that was that the ""Young"" deer of the two was definit=
ely the ""dominant"" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my ""ol' ba=
stard"" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was pass=
ed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older =
one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger =
sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to ""pour the Chili"" =
while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the ""stud"", =
ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stu=
d, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anyth=
ing. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a=
 Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and=
 doesn't ""disappear"" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from =
year to year.=20

Jason:  fyi.  Also, Randy Curry did call me yesterday but wasn't available 
when I returned the call.
Also, let's get Sakura Dellsher executed (and we should create a file since 
we're noting the ADM agreement which we did for Bridgeline).  Could we please 
talk this afternoon about outstanding agreements?  ss

hello Sara,

I think this should be a high priority once they take on an ISDA attorney.  
Per your recommendation, I contacted Randy Curry, President of Bridgeline and 
passed along your thoughts about Jason.  I gave him your phone number and he 
sounded enthusiastic about wanting to talk with him.  God knows they need an 
attorney.

Right now, I think we can take this off the priority list.

Thanks
Brant

haven't heard from these guys since April 13.  Sara

Greetings:

Attached is the draft.  I've attempted to capture everyone's comments.  The 
only piece that is not likely to go this evening is the piece providing 
comments on the Governor's specific proposals.  That will likely go first 
thing tomorrow morning.  You'll note that only one of the Governor's 
proposals currently has any comments attached to it.  Comments on the 
Governor's proposals are appreciated.  The remainder of the materials will go 
to the Governor's staff later this evening; so any and all comments on those 
portions are welcomed and appreciated.  Thanks to all for the assistance, 
particularly in light of the holiday.

Best,
Jeff"

FYI - this is set up and has been added as a tab to the bankruptcy post id sheet(CAN).  If you open the attachment, you will see she set these up as MMBTU/USD books in Risktrac.  I talked with Cecilia and she has changed this in ERMS/TAGG effective today to be GJ/CAD.  Not sure how this happened, but it is fixed now.  Should not have any problems, there is nothing in this book currently.  Let me know if we need to calc these when I get back on Wednesday.

Subject: DJ Class Action/Calif Generators-3: Antitrust Law Violated


19:42 GMT 28 November 2000 DJ Class Action/Calif Generators-3: Antitrust Law
Violated
The ""class"" - the plaintiffs - are defined as anybody who bought power
through the California Power Exchange last summer, but largely represents
the 1.2 million customers of Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., according to the complaint.
The complaint alleges the defendants violated antitrust laws.
The plaintiffs allege that the generators named in the suit deliberately
withheld their power supply from the CalPX forward market, scheduled
unplanned power plant outages and congested transmission lines last summer
in an effort to drive up wholesale power prices.
Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), operates five power plants in
California. Atlanta-based Southern Company (SO) operates six generation
units in the state; Houston-based Duke Energy (DUK) operates four power
plants; Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) operates eight power plants in
California; Arlington, Va.-based AES operates four, Tulsa, Okla.-based
Williams Energy operates three generation units and Minneapolis-based NRG
operates eight power plants.
In addition, the suit claims the California Independent System Operator,
manager of the state's high voltage transmission system, wrongfully supplied
the Western Systems Coordinating Council, an agency that manages electricity
reliability in the west, with real-time information about power plant
outages and electricity generating and capacity levels that was used by
generators to manipulate the market.
""Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity market
participants ... were thereby given access to real-time data as to their
competitors' actions, although access to such data was forbidden by the
ISO's (rules),"" the complaint states.
""Starting on or about May 22, 2000, defendants used such real-time data to
exercise market power, by among other things, reducing their (electricity)
output, strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and
exporting electricity from the state in order to drive up"" power prices, the
complaint further states.
The defendants weren't immediately available for comment.

OUR BIGGEST VOLUME EVER. . . . 3 YEARS RUNNING!

            THE MILLIONS CD - VOL. 14

>>> 19 MILLION NEW Addresses - Just Released! <<<
THE VERY BEST email addresses available anywhere!!

Our research has found that many people have
tried one or more of the following...

Free Classifieds?  (Don't work)
Web Site?          (Takes thousands of visitors)
Banners?           (Expensive and iffy)
E-Zine?            (They better have a huge list)
Search Engines?    (Easily buried with thousands of others)

S O   W H A T   D O E S   W O R K ?

Although often misunderstood, there is one method
that has proven to succeed time-after-time.

      E - M A I L   M A R K E T I N G   ! !

It's a fact!  If you're not using your computer to generate income,
you're leaving money on the table.

Here's what the experts have to say about E-Mail Marketing:

""A gold mine for those who can take advantage of
bulk e-mail programs"" - The New York Times

""E-mail is an incredible lead generation tool""
-Crains Magazine

""Blows away traditional Mailing"" - Advertising Age

Here is an example of your potential earnings if you have a product that
brings you a profit of around $30.  Remember, on the Internet, you can
make money 7 days a week, 24 hours a day... even while you sleep, orders
come from all over the world!

Orders Per Day   Weekly Earnings /  Monthly Earnings /  Yearly Earnings
    1              $210.00           $840.00             $10,080.00
    2              $420.00           $1,680.00           $20,160.00
    3              $630.00           $2,520.00           $30,240.00
    5              $1,050.00         $4,200.00           $50,400.00
   10              $2,100.00         $8,400.00           $100,000.00
   15              $3,150.00         $12,600.00          $151,200.00

THE QUESTION IS... how do you generate those orders?


               THE MILLIONS CD - VOL. 14


The Millions CD - VOL. 14, is the ABSOLUTE BEST product of
its kind anywhere in the world today. There are NO OTHER
products ANYWHERE that can compete with the quality of this CD.

O N E   O F   A   K I N D

This CD is a first.  No one... and we mean NO ONE has put in
the kind of work it takes to produce a CD of this quality.
We've been in the list brokerage business for over 5 years and
we've never compromised on quality.  We won't release any address
list until it passes our ""high standards"" test.

 Our claim to fame, is that our addresses are deliverable!
The number #1 problem with email lists are deliverability.  You may
have seen dozens of ads for lists or CD's or you may have purchased
a list in the past.  Chances are, the list was produced 6 months, 1 year
or even two years ago!  Not ours, a new volume CD comes out
every  6-7 weeks.

Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists:

1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates.

2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even
more. No address with inappropriate or profane wording survive!

3. Then, a special filter file is used to eliminate the
""Web Poisoned"" e-mail addresses from the list.  Our
EXCLUSIVE system reduced these ""poison"" addresses to near
zero.  You may have seen CD's with 30, 40, 50 million addresses,
not only do they contain may undeliverable addresses, but most
are notorious for millions of these ""poisoned""  email addresses.

4. Next we used our private database of thousands of known
""extremists"" and kicked off every one we could find.  NOTE:
We maintain the world's largest list of individuals and
groups that are opposed to any kind of commercial
e-marketing... they are gone, nuked!

5. We sorted the list into easy-to-manage  packets of 20,000 addresses
in a simple text (.txt) format.

6. All domains have been verified as valid.

WHAT DID WE END UP WITH?

Volume 14... 19 Million Addresses Strong!

         * N O   B R A G   -   J U S T   F A C T *

Getting this CD is equivalent to buying EVERY CD sold by
almost everyone else, combined... EXCEPT - it has been
cleaned and the quality is unsurpassed by any list in existence!

With our super clean lists you'll send less...and get better
results... plus you can start mailing as soon as you receive
your CD!

   * Y O U   G E T   W H A T   Y O U   P A Y   F O R *

Our 19 Million, Volume 14, address CD will result in:

* Higher Response Rates
* Higher Sales Conversion Ratios
* More Receptive prospects; Less Flames & Non-Buyers.
* Less Contact With Anti-Commerce Radicals & Extremists.

Remember that potential income chart at the beginning of
this message? Can you imagine the kind of money you could
make if you mailed one million pieces and sold only one
tenth (.01%) of one percent?  You do the math, you'll be
amazed!

This product will prove to be the best of it's kind compared
to ANY CD in terms of hours and money spent bringing it to
market. No competitor will ever duplicate the effort of what
it takes for us to produce this superb product.

We never have compromised on quality, and surely won't
release any product before it passes our ""high standards""
test.

This is not a rental list that is restricted to a one-time
mailing.  You are purchasing an e-mail address list for your own
personal mailings and may use it over-and-over.

It's your choice... ""Buy ALL the rest or buy the BEST""!

DON'T HESITATE on this offer or you will miss out on the
most effective way to market anywhere...PERIOD!

Order within 72 hours and we'll include the following FREE
Bonuses... we call this our ""BUSINESS ON A DISK"" bonus.

It's sad, but many people purchase address cd's...and then
spend additional hundreds buying the specialized software to
enable them to send their mail out.  Then they have to
search for days-and-months on end to find a product that
will sell on the 'net.

We've solved that problem entirely with our exclusive
""BUSINESS ON A DISK"" bonus offer:

1. A Professional Mailing Software.  This proven software
has sold for as high as $399.00.  This is not a demo, but
a full working version. It is what the pro's have used for
years and is simply THE BEST mailing software. This Mailer
saves the resources of your ISP by utilizing its' own Mail
Server/Client/Routing/ system. You don't pass a single copy
of e-mail through your dial-up's mail servers... or any
type of third party relaying for that matter. Stay one step
ahead of the competition with these incredible features!

(SORRY, SINCE IT IS FREE WE CANNOT OFFER ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT,
however set-up instructions and ""help"" files are included).

2. Every survey has always indicated that the easiest and
most profitable product to sell on the Internet is
INFORMATION!  If you have an ""information"" type product,
then there is no easier way to become financially
independent.

Our ""BUSINESS ON A DISK"" gives you 500 reports/manuals/books
that that are yours to use.  You may instantly start your
""Information Product"" business!

Just think, you can reproduce a complete book on a floppy disc in just
a few seconds, for around 35 cents.  These are the same books that have
sold for $99.  ""Special Reports"" cost you pennies to produce and can be
sold for as high as $15... or the whole group for as high as $140.00.

3. ""THE BULK E-MAIL SURVIVAL GUIDE""  A manual/guide that
addresses the Bulk E-Mail business.  Especially useful for
beginners.  ""THE BULK E-MAIL SURVIVAL GUIDE"" will answer
most of your questions and concerns about Bulk E-Mail.  An
exclusive for our customers... INCLUDED FREE.

4. List Management Software - This is the software the
Pro's use to manage their mailing lists. (Not a demo!)

5.  We've also included a professional extracting software
(fully functional demo that you can try and use).
This is the specialized e- mail software that the ""heavy hitters"" are
using day-in and day-out to bring in hundreds of orders.

you order within the next 72 hours.

		 Subject: Re: California says clean air not power crisis cause

Kenny's comments are absolutely false or, at best,  grossly misleading.  We 
need to respond to him.

The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed 
power plant developments is securing ERCs.  My discussions with Calpine 
indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well.  (And in case someone 
hasn't noticed, the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and 
Calpine.)  Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down, and slowing 
others down, which keeps the new, cleaner plants from being developed.  As I 
have mentioned before, this is actually making air quality worse in that the 
older, dirtier plants are running more.  Further, if you do the math, we will 
probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty 
plants in business because of grandfathering, while the clean plants don't 
get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs.    

Having said that, I do not agree that we should send a message that we want 
to relax or suspend the standards.  (However, getting 2ppm plants on line, 
which will put out of business the 100+ppm plants - as Calpine indicated to 
me happened in Texas - makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension 
is the environmentally appropriate thing to do.)  All in all, though, I 
believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California 
because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public 
will make sure that we pay for such a message.  Having said that, I will 
repeat the key things that we should be promoting, in my opinion:  1.)  stop 
the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of 
insanity.  (GE will not guarantee the present, and new, EPA requirement of 
2ppm, which EPA ""determined"" with no new operating data.  They just did it 
because they could.)  2.)  Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments.  (Kelly 
Brodbeck is working very hard, for example, to develop a program in the Bay 
Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs.  A high 
level staff guy at BAAQMD ""believes"" that we should be RACT adjusted, 
probably making the program uneconomic.  There isn't even unanimity for this 
position on his staff.  However, this position if it sticks is irresponsible 
in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are 
doing.  We are creating ERCs, which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in 
their haircut, and in using the ERCs, we will eventually put out of business 
the dirtier plants.  So, our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets 
dirtier...)  3.)  Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying 
ERCs.  There is precedent for that, but this has to be run through the SIP 
and the EPA.  Again, the in-lieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC 
developments (e.g., electric lawn mowers, electric water heaters, etc.), 
which will clean the air.  I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA 
legislature on this.  Go Sandy!

California regulators told congressional lawmakers on Thursday that clean air 
regulations are not to blame for the state's electricity shortages and said 
new legislation seeking to ease air quality rules was unneeded. 
Speaking at a House Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing, the 
head of the California Air Resources Board repeatedly said environmental 
regulations should not be suspended for the sake of electricity. 
""Air quality laws are not interfering with California's ability to bring new 
generation on line and run existing power plants at maximum capacity,"" said 
Michael Kenny, executive officer of the board. 
When asked by Democratic lawmakers on the panel about a provision in a 
pending electricity bill, the California regulator said the state did not ask 
for a relaxation of clean air rules and did not need the change. 
""We believe that air quality-related sections of the legislation are 
unnecessary,"" Kenny said. 
Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who chairs the energy subcommittee, 
said the measures allow flexibility to states for the temporary suspension of 
environmental laws. He said the key point of his bill is to ensure the lights 
stay on in California this summer. 
The Golden State expects to face threats of blackouts starting this month, 
when air conditioning use accelerates. 
Objections raised by Kenny to the Barton bill included disagreement on a 
section allowing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to waive, when 
asked by a state, the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to 
nitrogen oxide emissions. 
Kenny said the state already gives flexibility on the issue and contended the 
legislation would go too far and be problematic. 
""The waiver applies to all new generation facilities in the state and does 
not allow for consideration on a case-by-case (generating plant by generating 
plant) basis, where unique local factors can be weighed,"" said Kenny.

Earlier this week the NY PSC finally issued its Order approving competitive 
billing options and requiring the utilities to develop ""back-out"" credits for 
this service based on long-run avoided costs.  The Order is an extremely 
pro-competition statement and contains language that should prove useful in 
other State proceedings where competitive billing (and metering) is being 
debated.  A copy of the Order is attached.  In brief, it allows single 
billing by the ESCO or by the Utility (at the customer/ESCO's request) and 
directs the utilities to file their tariffs with back-out credits by April 
24, 2000.  There will be a brief collaborative review of the filings in May 
and June.  The new tariffs are to go into effect October 2, 2000.

Below is a message from a company by the name of Cavio who specializes in 
software that streamlines the settlements process.  More information about 
their products can be found at http://www.cavio.com/.  They would like to 
visit Enron and discuss the potential of partnering with us.  Essentially 
they would charge our customers a fee for the process of clearing or settling 
their transactions and share a portion of the revenue with Enron.  The 
benefit to our customers is a reduced cost for letters of credit.  

Bottom line is that they would like to meet with us and see if their is any 
interest in trying to put something together.  Please let me know if you are 
interested in being a part of the meeting and I will coordinate setting it 
up.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Dear Tommy, 
Further to my phone message to you on Wednesday morning, I have great news. 
It appears the last points have been ironed out and that CheMatch will be 
going forward with the Cavio Solution.  Our CEO and VP of Sales will be 
attending a meeting with CheMatch in Houston in mid to late January.  As 
well, interest has been shown from the Natural Gas Exchange (www.ngx.com) and 
Automated Power Exchange (www.apx.com).  From our discussions, it has become 
apparent that these two sites currently deal with Enron at some level and 
both agree that the Cavio Solution could effect a positive change in the lag 
time currently seen for billing cycles (up to 55 days) as well as providing 
other benefits.  I feel that with Enron and CheMatch setting a new standard 
with Cavio, many of your current clients will be eager to join, and your 
competition will be left behind.
Based on the fact that you had expressed interest in Cavio and Beta testing 
the Cavio Solution for trades currently happening between Cheats and Enron,  
I think that it may be an ideal time to plan a meeting with your team in 
conjunction with our meeting with CheMatch.  
Please advise as soon as possible. 
Thanks.

Happy New Year.  Would you mind if I used you as a recommender for a job I am
currently chasing at Cisco Systems, Inc.?  I have been talking to them about
an Assistant Treasurer job.  The opportunity came through an executive search
firm, Heidrick & Struggles, and they would like to visit with some people in
regard to my background, deal skills, origination skills and integrity.
Thank you very much.  I hope all is well and I look forward to catching up
soon.

Dear George
I trust all is well. In advance of Kemm's presentation to your team on
Wednesday, I am attaching our WEFA Energy Services brochure to better
familiarize your team with the WEFA services available to you. I realize
Kemm will be focusing on Power, the brochure simply provides additional WEFA
background as a courtesy.

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Diana & Stewart

I am hoping one of you can help me.  I am trying to send aninvoice out to City of Shasta Lake, but there is a deal we don't show in view actuals,or CARP, etc. so it's not part of the numbers I have to invoice then on - but they say they owe it to us.  It is the transmission capacity deal #839722.1 for City of Shasta Lake.  They see they owe us for this deal in the amount of $36,600.  Stewart, I had faxed you the confirm on #659898.1. It was a Laird Dyer deal and you were going to see if you could find out how we would settle it.  I am not sure if the two deals are related, but maybe they are?  Could the two of you look into these and let me know.  I need to invoice them with deal #839722.1, and I also need to know if we need to do anything for deal #659898.1.  Let me know.

Thanks - Amy"

don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing 
power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in 
oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in 
Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our 
fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring 
into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in 
EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are 
setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping 
origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you 
make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in 
the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's 
and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, 
structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are 
pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an 
Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant 
development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan 
or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our 
projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call 
Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

 The swing ticket for Beaumont Methanol ""meter #1428"" {#249208} expired June 
30th.
 Bob Dorcheus indicated that  HPL should take the swing during July.
 
 Should  I expect another swing ticket to be negotiated for July ?
 
 Presently, the swing activity is hitting the ""baseload"" ticket {#314854}  
which is 15.0/day.

I propose to write a brief note to Mrs Plitsch to say that it was a matter is between the company and Mr Plitsch which has been settled with Mr Plitsch's participation. Mr Plitsch was given every opportunity to consult his lawyers and put his case but he declined. We take a very serious view of this abuse of our company's letterhead and chop, but would now consider matter closed. 

Please let me know if you think it ought to come directly from senior management (which I imagine would be too busy to attend to this). If not, I'll sign and send the letter tomorrow  (Singapore time) and copy to Mark Frevert with blind copy to yourselves. 

Thanks and regards

Mark, Alan,

This lady has written to most of the senior executives in the company trying to recover some of the money which we believe her husband misappropriated from Enron in Hong Kong. Matt Lee obtained orders freezing the husband's bank accounts and he immediately repaid us.

We have written at least twice explaining we are not prepared to pay any of this back. I'll ask Matt to do so again one last time.

to present next month for both groups (above).  We need a list of settlements 
persons who should be invited.  The purpose of the meeting is to provide an

Subject: Greg Smith of Cynet called me just now


and informed me that the $2.2 million HEOF committed to Cynet was in
escrow as of September 9, and not actually invested in cynet itself as
the escrow was pending the rescission financing.  The actual financing
closed in December of 1999.  It turned out that HEOF THEN (not before)
invested not only the $2.2 million that was in escrow as of the valuation
date but an additional $220,000.

I think the valuation implications are obvious.

I took the liberty of handling this directly with Greg; if you have any
other questions, please feel free to call him.

This just leaves Creole Shack (Roland Curry) who has never gotten back to
me, and we are done with our calls and can proceed to finalize our
reports.

Ben

The Turbopark funds request for all payments to be made next month needs to 
be submitted by Tuesday, June 12th.  This request covers the period from June 
15th to July 15th.  Are we planning to pay the $1.5 MM invoice from GE during 
this time period?  If so, I will have accounting request the funds.  If we're 
not sure if the payment will be made or not, it is better not to request the 
funds.  In this case, the payment can be treated as an ""actual"" for that 
month and backed out of the advance for next month.  Please let me know which 
course of action you would like to take.  

Thanks,
Rebecca

Just a few notes on scheduling:

The new VESTAL_6_WDFIRE unit's counterparty name is SierraPower.  This was 
being scheduled as Vestal but the counterparty name has been changed.

Also, there have been a few errors in scheduling the Wheelabrator units.  
They should be scheduled as follows:

Wheelabrat:  MARTEL_2_AMFOR
WheelSHAST:  WSENGY_1_UNIT 4

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions,

Here are some notes I have written up on discounting, present value, and
infinite series.  I hope these are helpful.  There seemed to be great
concern about this subject, some of which will hopefully be alleviated by
the attached notes.  It is in MS word format.  If this is a problem, let
me know.  You are always welcome to ask for individual help. I will be
sending out notes throughout the week on some of the more difficult
subjects we have covered.

Hi Professor Ronn:

I have ordered a flip chart and markers and an overhead projector.  

There were 11 pages in your presentation and they look fine.  We have 
already made the copies.

I believe everything is set - if you think of anything else, please let me 
know.

Enjoy your dinner tonight and we will see you tomorrow.

Regards,

There is one additional item I would request:  If the room does not contain
a blackboard or whiteboard, I would appreciate a flip chart and markers.

I am faxing you my Presentation Handout for tomorrow.  I would be grateful
if your produced copies in sufficient number for tomorrow's 11:30 a.m.
meeting; Vince advises me the number of attendees will be in the 25 - 30
range.  I will also bring along a ""master copy"" in case the trasmission
unduly mangles the fax.

Thanks,
Ehud

Taken from McCalls, March 2001 issue:

Heinous Husband Award
One night after I'd asked my husband, Keith, to bring our cat inside, he 
reported that she hissed at him.  The next morning I found out why she'd been 
hostile.  It wasn't our cat!  After Keith got home from work, I introduced 
him to Brandy--whom we've had for five years."""

Damn, it's good to be a man......

Your last name stays put.
The garage is all  yours.
Wedding plans take care of themselves.
Chocolate is just another snack.
You can be president.
You  can wear a white T-shirt to a water park.
Car  mechanics tell you the truth.
The world is your  urinal.
You never have to drive to another gas  station because this one's just
icky.
Same work, more pay.
Wrinkles add character.
Wedding dress - $5000; tux rental - $100.
People never stare at your chest when you're talking to them.
The occasional  well-rendered belch is practically expected.
New shoes don't cut, blister, or mangle your  feet.
One mood, ALL the damn time.
Phone conversations are over in 30 seconds flat.
You know stuff about tanks.
A five-day vacation requires only one suitcase.
You can open all your own jars.
You get extra credit for the slightest act of thoughtfulness.
If someone forgets to invite  you to something, he or she can still be a
friend.
Your  underwear is $8.95 for a three-pack.
If you are  34 and single, nobody notices.
Everything on  your face stays its original color.
Three pairs  of shoes are more than enough.
You don't have  to stop and think of which way to turn a nut on a  bolt.
You almost never have strap problems in  public.
You are unable to see wrinkles in your  clothes.
The same hairstyle lasts for years,  maybe decades.
You don't have to shave below  your neck.
Your belly usually hides your big  hips.
One wallet and one pair of shoes, one  color, all seasons.
You can ""do"" your nails with a pocketknife.
You  have freedom of choice concerning growing a mustache.
You can do Christmas shopping for 25  relatives, on December 24, in 45
minutes.

Jo Williams has asked me to help her update this map, to provide Enron Corp. 
""IT"" so they may add a  point and click map on the ""inter net"".  I have 
contacted some of you by phone to update the attached map, I am asking all of 
you to please carefully review this entire map, title, legend, numbers, 
spelling all of it.  Please reply whether you have changes or not, about the 
information that appears on it.  GIVE ME AN APPROVAL OR  DECLINE IT.  I 
realize this is short notice but we would need this at least by 3 :00 PM 
today Wed may 24th, Jo is trying to place this in the hands of Will Zamer 
today.
Keep in mind that this map will probably be revised from some of your 
comments, so it is NOT a map that should be distributed from any of you, in 
fact you can delete it after you've provided us the help. I will resubmit  
the final map upon it's completion. Thank-you all.
 All your time is greatly appreciated.
regards'
Maria Salazar

When:	Sunday, December 02, 2001 11:00 AM-1:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where:	Rice University (see attached map)

Guys:

Come on out this Sunday and take out some of your frustrations on the field.  We will have beer this time, so be prepared to have a few.  Forward this on to anyone else you can think of who'd like to play.

We're having a touch football game this Sunday the 2nd at Rice.  The attached map indicates the place where you should park (small white box with X in it) and where the game will take place (larger white box nearby).  Game time is 11AM, and we'll play until whenever everyone gets tired and goes home.

Teams will be picked on site.  There are several fields adjacent to one another, so we can play two games simultaneously if we have too many people for one game.  I will bring two footballs, and some cones for field boundaries.  Please feel free to bring other equipment as you see fit (e.g. - footballs, cones, flags, other if you have them).  Cleats are recommended if you own them already (and if not, go pick up a pair at Academy for $20).  Please bring your own water/food/beer/other refreshments.

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring ("" CEM"") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

Dear Rajan,

Sat sri akal. It was a pleasure to talk to you yesterday.I had discussed with 
you our programme for the return journey.Though our return journey is fixed 
on 18th of Nov. but due to circumstances as discussed with you yesterday ,we 
may have to extend our stay for a couple of months if we could get clearance 
from INS for which AP has applied. In the meantime ,if we could have an 
understanding with Dimpy/Ap we may move earlier as planned. Any case we must 
keep more medicines so that at that time we may not have any problem. I 
therefore  will greatly appreciate if you can arrange to get the following 
medicines from India with Raj's mother who is coming  in the next month and 
then later on these can be sent to us.

STAMLO BETA                 15x10   =150 Tab (15 strips of 10 each)

  I am sure you must be sending your authority to MSDANG at Delhi . I will 
talk with u on phone in the evening. Rest is OK.Winter has started here. With 
our lot of love to you and hope to have a tea -te-te in the evening.

Carolina Power & Light Company and Florida Power Corporation, on July 16, 2001, filed revisions to their Open Access Transmission Tariffs.  

The modification provides that the Tariffs Generator Interconnection Procedures, Attachment O, apply only in the CP&L zone.  

The companies state that the purpose of the filing is to correct an April 26, 2001 filing that  inadvertently did not limit the applicability of the Attachment.

If you would like more information on this filing, please let me know.

Steve, Mark and Meredith,

Please find below some emails between EFET (European Federation of Energy 
Traders) and myself.  We have helped them to find out which German 
journalists the German gas incumbent, Ruhrgas, has sent to California this 
week.  We found out about that yesterday.  I have now passed on that list + 
some general PR recommendations and EFET will now take the lead on this (they 
will send out an EFET position paper on California and have a spokesperson 
available especially for California - he's not Enron!).

Just wanted to make sure you are aware because it could be possible that 
people will come to us for further comment.  The general consensus now is 
that we then refer them to EFET.

Thanks
Eva

Subject: journalists in California sent by Ruhrgas

Jan,

Please  see below a summary of the journalists who will be returning this 
weekend from their trip to California courtesy of Ruhrgas. 

Up to you now to send them the EFET position paper on California.  Would 
suggest you try to get it on their desk by Monday morning latest, if 
possible.  Would also send it to those who have refused to go and other key 
contacts we have given to you.  Media seems to be keen to know EFET's 
position on this.  Let me know if you need translation of the personalised 
note that will accompany the position paper. Obviously, we will divert any 
requests we get to you. Will get their email addresses to you later so you 
can email it to them rather than fax it with the possibility they will get it 
too late. 

Good luck.

Groet
Eva

Subject: journalists in California


Eva,

I've finished my guerilla-PR-job, here are the results:

Ruhrgas has invited the Nordrhein-Westfalen (region where Essen is located)
-based correspondents of the national dailies and also the energy
journalists of the most important business magazines.

Journalists in Califonia:
-Werner Sturbeck (FAZ - Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung)
-Werner Jaspert (S_ddeutsche Zeitung)
-Dr. J_rgen Frech (WAZ - Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung
-Jochen Schuster (Focus)

Journalists that had been invited but refused:
-Dr. Andreas Wildhagen (Wirtschaftswoche)
-Hans-Willy Bein (Financial Times Deutschland)
-Die Welt

I also got the information that Ruhrgas held a press conference yesterday
in California. So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrow
or latest on Monday. I also will do an additional internet monitoring (for
example WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there are
already some articles.

We should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to those
journalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts. Most of
the journalists I spoke to or colleagues from the newsdesk seem to be keen to
know what EFET has to say about the California issue!!!!!

Please let me know if you need further information!

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

Mike,

The Research Group is looking at some counterintuitive results we could 
observe
 recently in the Value-at-Risk for the aggregate storage book.

I think that the results the system is producing are incorrect and
that we should use instead the number produced by
straightforward addition of Value-at-Risk numbers for the storage book
subportfolios.

We are actively working with the IT to review the code and locate the source
of the  problem. We should also review the interactions between the 
spreadsheet
that contains the storage book and the Value-at-Risk system database.

All,

Further to your recent discussions surrounding the ENA Origination Track I will shortly be scheduling an interview date for you to interview recommended candidates.    You have already received the attached list of suggested candidates and as I understand it you have no comments on these individuals thus far.   

In order to match the success of the ENA Trading Track it requires your 100% commitment and participation in the following areas:

1.	Interviewing
2.	Training
3.	Mentoring
4.	Promotion of the Track

I will contact each supervisor of the attached list of candidates to gain further feedback on these candidates, prior to contacting them, and ensure their respective buy-in.

 
If you have any questions please call me.

I look forward to working with you on this Track.

Kind regards,

Karen Buckley

Hi Steve -

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service. 
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.

I had particularly emphasized the need to define the functions of Control Areas that we want independent from the vertical utilities so that we can leverage that to push for single control areas.

Camp Hill, PA 17011
eradicator_97@hotmail.com

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

James D'Angelo"

Due to performance issues with our plasma screens we have restricted access to the EOL feeds to the plasma machines themselves.
You can however still access the NYMEX strip on the right utilizing the following links.  If you know anyone else who has need

Subject: Response to Comments

Karen:
Here is our response to your e-mail comments:

1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the 
provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn 
upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent 
with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to 
those other sections.

2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am 
unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to 
amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is 
your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) 
of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.

3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default 
situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).

4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability 
issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master 
permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

OK - we'll get on the Crude Oil list right away - and I'll touch base with John Nowlan.

I assume that Gas & Power is still an area we will hold off on for now?

Is this an incorporated entity? I assume its authority to trade a range of 
products has been checked out? In Australia this assumption can not be made 
for government  entities

Under our licencing requirements we need to make reasonable enquiries that a 
counterparty has (or is guaranted by someone who has) atleast USD6 million in 
assets. Can this assumption be made?

Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do 
power).  David, when I talk about this I am never including credit 
derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that 
this is a credit derivatives counterparty.

I need you to make the changes in the email, including the date. I want redlines to be able to show the signers the changes, as well as the other lawyers.  Maybe copying the doc to a new file will help.

Subject: High Speed Regulation in California - CERA Alert


Title: High Speed Regulation in California
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2208


A Feverish Pitch
The pace of regulatory and political events in California has taken on the
feverish pitch of the energy market crisis itself. Important decisions
regarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at=
=20
the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state Legislature,
increasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already percei=
ve
in the quickly evolving California market. Sudden changes are being made to=
=20
the
market structure, changes that used to require years in California=01,s com=
plex
regulatory and legislative proceedings.

As rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of Northern Califor=
nia
on January 17 and 18, including in portions of downtown San Francisco,
Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley, state officials are scrambling to set u=
p
the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarc=
e
western energy supplies to California=01,s two largest utilities. Even at p=
rices
near $800 per megawatt-hour (MWh), the California Department of Water=20
Resources
(CDWR), attempting to buy power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E=
)
and Southern California Edison (SCE), has been unable to secure enough to k=
eep
the lights on. In the mean time, legal actions by some energy suppliers
threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy=01*and are being held at bay =
only=20
by
direct intervention of California=01,s governor.

Below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently:

*California governor. California Governor Gray Davis continues to attempt t=
o
act on behalf of PG&E and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from
merchant generation owners and marketers in California. On the same front, =
the
governor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them fr=
om
seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utiliti=
es.
Court-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy.

*Legislature. Bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchas=
es
on behalf of PG&E and SCE by the CDWR, to restructure the independent syste=
m
operator=01,s (ISO) governing board to consist of five members appointed by=
 the
governor, to restrict the ability of the ISO to enter into a broader=20
interstate
regional transmission organization (RTO) without the explicit approval of
California=01,s Electricity Oversight Board, and to prohibit the divestitur=
e of
the investor-owned utilities=01, remaining generating assets until 2006. Th=
e
vehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition =
of
transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still
being developed.

*California Public Utilities Commission. On January 18 the CPUC adopted a
decision prohibiting the sale of SCE=01,s Mohave Generating Station to AES.=
 This
voids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed=20
decisions
regarding SCE=01,s application to end its rate freeze and the prudency crit=
eria
for utilities entering into long-term supply contracts.

Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their
respective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass=20
through
multiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to
decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to
California=01,s two largest utilities, or the level of uncertainty in devel=
oping
new generation to supply California in the future.

The ISO anticipates that it will call stage 3 emergencies (reserves less th=
an
1.5 percent) for January 19 and will most likely continue to curtail
interruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are be=
ing
strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water=20
supplies
are already as much as 25 percent below average, owing to low precipitation=
=20
and
continued plant outages near 9,000 MW in California. The gravity of the
financial condition of California=01,s two largest utilities is exemplified=
 by=20
the
need for other, more creditworthy intermediaries, including California
municipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers,=
 to
act as temporary  guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PG&=
E
and SCE.

Really? Jesus, I thought for sure I got charged. Didn't seem like I had any
extra cash on hand. I have to make sure they didn't charge me... Anyway,
I'll take care of that debt. What a joke! What happened when you put the
room on my card, Cameron? Why did I get so rejected at the ATM all weekend?

Damn irresponsible ski bums...

ir behind the storm now exiting the NE turned out to be a little colder tha=
n expected as 20's and 30's are widespread this morning even down to the Gu=
lf Coast. The first real Lake Effect snows of the season are underway in th=

not slightly above normal this afternoon. But, it is a part of a stepping d=
own in temperatures that has gradually occurred over the last week to 10 da=

from there. I do expect some Christmas weekend snows in the Northern fringe=

 period in over two months that runs cold. Relative to normal, it may not b=

 East Coast. But all models in this time frame have a strong ridge West/tro=

Mercury News, 7/3: Blackout hits Las Vegas

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------


Blackout hits Las Vegas as number 120 comes up 
And California calls its first power alert since May as the mercury soars. 
July 3, 2001 
From staff and news service reports 
Las Vegas suffered its first rolling blackout ever Monday as soaring 
temperatures and churning air conditioners outstripped the local utility's 
ability to provide electricity. 
Nevada Power Co. cut about 100 megawatts, or enough electricity for 75,000 
homes, for about an hour. 
Scattered outages were reported around the Las Vegas area, where temperatures 
reached 120 degrees. Earlier, the utility asked its major power users, 
including the neon-lit resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, for voluntary 
reductions. Casinos instituted conservation measures largely not noticeable 
by guests. 
Meanwhile, in California, high temperatures led the Independent System 
Operator to declare an emergency alert for the first time since May 31. 
A Stage 1 alert was called at 1:35 p.m. as reserves fell below 7 percent of 
demand. The alert was upgraded to a Stage 2 at 2:40 p.m., meaning reserves 
fell below 5 percent. 
The alert didn't trigger new wholesale price limits under a system recently 
ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under the FERC rules, a 
Stage 1 alert must be in effect for a full clock hour (i.e., 2 to 3 p.m.) to 
reset the caps, said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the ISO. Since the 
Stage 1 was upgraded to Stage 2 before a clock hour passed, that condition 
was not met, she said. The cap, designed to prevent price spikes, remains at 
$92 a megawatt-hour."

I'm running out the door to go drinking with the boys at front porch, right next to my apartment.  

I don't think your dad would like me so much.  Will explain later.

Sorry about your day.  Maybe you can find some happiness in the book of prayers.  Maybe you can find more happiness in the money.

Talk to you later.

Today. Definitely in the top 10 as far as crappy days go. Started out great.
Breakfast with Dad was nice (LePeep by my house). He was very happy I broke
up with the energy guy. Wasn't too keen on him being Jewish. Dad's pretty
religious in his elder years. Gave me a book of prayers and money....That's
what I'm talkin' about!! (I'm going to he@@). Anyway, my boss calls me as we
are finishing up and asks me if I knew anything about a meeting I was
supposed to be working for NP's (nurse practitioners) at the Westin and I'm
like ""Uh, No...never got the message"". Well, never got the message because
she never sent it. Bottom line, I had to blow off all my plans(I was
actually planning on calling on doctors today and getting ready for my
monday program) and go work this meeting which isn't that big of deal. We
just stand around at display tables and answer questions from the
doctors/NP's. I was there for and hour and then went to lunch. I came back
for an hour and have to do some things here. The good thing about my boss is
she's very ""hand's off"". She stays out of your business unless you call her
for something. She has a life outside of this job which is rare for
managers. The bad thing is she can be ""flighty"" sometimes and forgets to
send things on or lets them pile up and we get the messages a week late
(which is probably what happened in this case)

Anyway, sorry about all the griping but I was on a roll!!

Hope your day has been good. You workin' out or goin' out after work?
Decisions. Decisions. Your gym sounds cool. Laughed at the physique comment.
So something I would have said.

Later,

d

This is awsome and at the same time rather chilling.  Mother nature is
spectacular
This awesome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he was
working while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it so he
should
at least be recognized as the photographer of this once in a lifetime
shot

Doug -

Pursuant to our discussions, attached is a copy of the revised letter for 
Peoples.  I have modified it to fit the current proposal and added some 
language believed to be necessary at this time.  You will also note that 
there is language indicating an assignment of this receivable to 
CommodityLogic.  There will need to be a document between ENA and CL to 
reflect this on an internal basis.  I will work on something later today so 
that we can properly document this matter.

Please look over the attached and let me know your comments.  I have copies 
Kay since she was responsible for reviewing the first letter and welcome her 
comments also.

I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware that Andy Brady is taking on the role as Project Manager for the Rates & Revenue project.  Wendy is taking on the role as Requirements and Design Manager for Rates & Revenue.  All project related questions regarding the Rates & Revenue project should be directed to Andy.   

Jeanne is taking responsibility for all remaining CMS/CRS/CAS project efforts including the TW CMS/CRS implementation as well as all CMS/CRS/CAS production support related items.  Please direct all inquiries regarding these applications to Jeanne.

These individuals will be working together to complete this transition by February 1st.  Thanks for your support as we make these changes.

Hello everyone!  As the United Way campaign gets kicked-off this year for 
Enron, I volunteered to be a team leader to help out with the campaign.  The 
big kick-off for Enron is tomorrow, Wednesday, August 9 at 11:15 at the Hyatt 
Regency.  GPG will be participating in a round of Enron's own game show, ""Who 
Wants to Help Millions for United Way?"".  To show our support for GPG's game 
show contestant and the United Way, Please join Stan Horton and your GPG 
co-workers at 11:00am at the wheelchair ramp on the Andrews side of the Enron 
Building to walk to the Hyatt together.  Dress casual and wear a BLUE shirt 
to represent GPG proudly!

Also, mark your calendar for Monday, August 21 at 3:00pm in the Energizer for 
the GPG rally.

Enron has added an on-line pledging feature to the United Way campaign this 
year.  No more pledge cards to pass around!  I have seen a demo of the system 
and I must say it makes turning in your pledge very easy!  You will learn 
more about this tomorrow!  

Please plan to attend the Enron rally tomorrow!  I am available to provide 
you additional information about United Way or help answer any questions you 
may have about Enron's participation in the campaign so please don't hesitate 
to call me at Ext. 33098.  I look forward to seeing you there!  

Thanks, Kim Watson."

Sorry to bring it up again, but did we finally give up on UC/CSU?  Jessie 
Knight called me.  He's now the CEO of the Chamber of Commerce is S.D.  They 
plan to launch a campaign next week telling businesses in S.D. that the best 
thing to leave Sempra and switch to another provider.  (""Do you want the 
Legislature to manage your energy costs, or do you want to manage them 
yourself?"")  

They want to give illustrative examples of folks who've switched and how well 
they're doing.  Ray McNally's sister is an extremely enthusiastic Enron 
customer and is going to contact the Chamber.  Be useful to have a business 
or two, or, UC/CSU.  Know it's a long shot, but figured it don't hurt to try."

Hi Shelley:
I am getting out invitations for the shower today.  I am sending one to you 
and Alina so you can see it.  Here is the guest list so far:
Giok Boothe
Lisa Corder
Linda Corredor (co-hosting)
Jacque Daughtry
Sydney Free Duvall
Peggy Erwin
Nancy Ginsburg
Dawn Goddin
Ange Grout
Wendy Houghton
Barbara Howard
Stephanie Keesling
Carla McGinley
Kathy Mynarcik
Becky O'Reilly
Dorothy Pledger
Letha Russell
Pam Thyssen
Ann Turney
Patty Wehn-Glowski

I do need to clarify the following:
1)    Did you say yes to inviting Tami Head?  (My notes aren't clear.)
2)    You listed Cherie Otto on your list.  I know that she and Barbara 
Bakanic are very close friends.  Barbara is also in our S/S class when she is 
not teaching.  Do you think we should invite both of them?
3)    You were going to get me Gabby's (sp?) address.
4)    I thought of Maggie Van Syckle.  Are you close with her?

If there's any one else you think of, just let me know.
Thanks,
Barbara"

Subject: Recycling Summary Integration plan

Please find attached the summary integration plan that you requested during 
our debriefing last week. 

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in 
place at 31 Dec 2000 when Enron Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

Naomi

""It is human nature to think wisely and to act in an absurd
fashion."" -- Anatole France


AGILENT EARNS ITS ""A""
Agilent tops estimates and moves to the head of the class.

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

If there were truth in ticker symbols, Agilent (NYSE: A) would
be holding up its ""A"" report card proudly. With quarterly
estimates pegged at $0.53 a share, the electronics testing
equipment maker powered up expectations with a $0.69-a-share showing.

That was a 77% surge in bottom-line growth before charges on
$3.4 billion in revenues for the September period. That's
welcome news for a company that has seen its shares fall sharply
since peaking at $162 back in March.

However, a slowdown in microchip testing equipment as well as
weakness in the wireless market has the company warning of
slower growth ahead. With a healthy backlog of orders, Agilent
still expects to meet estimates of $0.45 for the current
quarter.

Spun off by Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HWP) last year, Agilent will
be deploying new capital into areas where it sees higher growth:
communications and life sciences. I guess that gives the company
an ""A"" for effort too.
_________________________________________________________________

NEWS TO GO

Chipped off the old block, semiconductor distributor Avnet
(NYSE: AVT) announced that earnings for the current quarter
would come in between a nickel to a dime below the $0.85-a-share
forecast. While acknowledging the cyclical ways of the chip
industry, the company believes that earnings for the rest of the
year will remain on track.

Attention holiday shoppers, Nieman Marcus (NYSE: NMG.A) reported
stronger-than-expected profits but warned of slow action at the
registers so far this month. That's critical as the upscale
department store chain heads into the important buying season.
Nobody wants to see the Grinch steal Christmas (well, OK, it did
top the box office this past weekend, but that's another story).

EDGAR Hoovered? The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)
site for electronic financial filing and data retrieval will go

Has Ozzy Osbourne bitten off more than he can chew -- again? The
legendary showman is suing Hughes Electronics (NYSE: GMH) and
MCY.com (Nasdaq: MCYC) for broadcasting an Ozzfest 2000 concert
tour stop to Hughes' DirecTV subscribers. Osbourne claims that
tour sponsor MCY.com only had rights to a Web cast of the rock
event. Mr. Crowley will not be his legal counsel.

Deere (NYSE: DE) John? An epic Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL)? Hit the
Fluor (NYSE: FLR)? These questions and more will be answered as
the companies get set to release earnings today.

Philip,

What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you may
wish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when I
joined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few
not so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW
with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing
you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down
much.  I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW.

Hope everything else is going well for you and the family.  Have you had
the knee surgery yet?  Give me a call when you have a chance.

Later,

Al Pollard

Remember to join Enron Global Services Chairman & CEO Stan Horton on an eSpeak session Thursday, October 18 at 10 a.m. Houston time where he will answer questions regarding the new EGS. This is a great opportunity to get first hand information about what's going on within EGS and throughout Enron. 

If you can't make the live event, don't sweat it.  Go to http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp, and submit your question(s) today.  Stan will try to answer your questions during his ""open mike"" session, and you can read the transcript whenever you get the opportunity. 

Don't miss this opportunity to hear it straight from the top."

Below is my first rough draft of a letter that could be sent from consumers=

to FERC Chairman Hoecker.  Due to technical difficulties, I could not attac=
h=20
the letter in a separate document, so I copied the letter and have reprinte=

it below.

Having never been involved in this type of letter writing campaign, this wa=
s=20
a bit of a stab in the dark for me, so I welcome everyone's comments.  I am=

also working on a letter that could be sent by senior management or CEOs of=

high tech firms, but I wanted to get your feedback on this format before I=

went forward on the high tech letter.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

The Honorable James Hoecker
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First Street, N.E.
Washington, D.C.

Re: Electric Power Industry Reform

Dear Chairman Hoecker:

We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power.  We write to urg=
e=20
you and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable=
=20
shortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in t=
he=20
electric power industry.  It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry=20
Commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a=20
competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supply=
=20
of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers.

There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that t=
he=20
power supply in the U.S. remains sufficient and is available at reasonable=
=20
prices.  For example, you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in t=
he=20
nation=01,s electricity gird.  Under the current system, FERC regulations a=
llow=20
many companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their=20
transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers.  The result of this=
=20
policy is shortages, blackouts and skyrocketing prices.  Like the interstat=
e=20
highway system, FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to=20
another just as freely as motorists do.  All electricity suppliers should=
=20
have the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power =
to=20
where it is most needed.

FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers=01, reliance on spot and=
=20
short-term electricity markets for power supply.  Instead, FERC should urge=
=20
suppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term=20
contracts.  Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers=
=20
from unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating.

We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these=
=20
reforms.  Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more=20
reliable and economical.=20

Very truly yours,

Juan tells me that everything will be moved tomorrow sometime.  We want the 
cabinets to be locked for the move, so I'll lock them up tonight when I 
leave.  If you need to get in the files, grab the keys from my top drawer.  
Make sure to lock things up and replace the keys when you're done.  I'll 
unlock the stuff when it gets settled across the street tomorrow."

Subject: Re: Confidential  

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Sophie,

Here's Vince's comments on your proposal for Steve.  Also, what's a 2-Yr 
Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
bonus or incremental bonus?

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

 Why San Diego, Where Rates First Rose, No Longer Conserves Energy
 By LAURA M. HOLSON
   
 01/30/2001 
 The New York Times 
 Page 20, Column 1 
 c. 2001 New York Times Company 

 SAN DIEGO, Jan. 25 -- It was here, in the heat of last summer, that 
consumers got their initial lesson in how painful California's
 experiment with deregulation could be.

 With electricity supplies short and the state's power grid on the brink of 
collapse, wholesale electricity costs nearly tripled, and the San
 Diego Gas and Electric Company, the first utility in the state freed by 
deregulation, passed those costs on to its customers. Homeowners
 took to the streets, and businesses threatened to leave the city, 
California's second largest.

 Logic would suggest that San Diego consumers, having felt the price shock 
that the rest of the state so far had been shielded from, would
 be wiser about using electricity than other Californians. But the price 
shock was too short.

 In September, California legislators called off the experiment, capping 
retail electrical rates at 6.5 cents a kilowatt hour, the average market
 price paid in the month before the summer crisis.

 Now, six months later, San Diegans are back to their old ways.

 Electricity use, which dropped 9 percent in August, is back up to precrisis 
levels, according to San Diego Gas and Electric. Rather than
 investing in insulation or energy-efficient air-conditioners, consumers here 
seem to be hovering between denial and defiance.

 ''I feel I do all that I can to conserve,'' said Vicki Barber, an escrow 
coordinator for a real estate broker in San Diego. ''But I'm not going
 to spend all this money upgrading my house when it doesn't matter anyway.''

 As a test laboratory of consumer behavior when the cost of a necessity 
skyrockets, San Diego seems confused by how politicians reacted
 when consumers here revolted last summer, demanding relief.

 In September, when California legislators restored the lower rates, 
residential and small-business rate payers received credits on their utility
 bills -- even though the credits are really a postponed debt that is 
expected to come due as soon as 2002. And it is true that the utility's
 largest customers are already paying market rates.

 Still, Jeannie Thompson's reaction was typical. In August, Ms. Thompson, the 
branch manager of a Coldwell Banker real estate office in
 the Pacific Beach district, made it her business to turn off office lights 
and computers every night. ''When the news first came out, you
 wanted to do your part,'' she said.

 Then, in October, the office got its credit, and ''we started to go back to 
the way things were before.''

 Economists look at San Diegans' behavior and draw this lesson: Consumers 
must suffer a lot before they willingly give up comfort and
 conveniences they have grown used to.

 ''Summer should have been a wake-up call,'' said Peter Navarro, associate 
professor of economics and public policy at the University of
 California at Irvine. ''You can't blame San Diego consumers for not doing 
anything, because legislators stepped in and lowered prices. If
 the discomfort isn't of a lengthy duration, the adjustments to behavior that 
need to take place won't.''

 Indeed, in a recent paper, a group of energy experts and economists, 
including two Nobel Prize winners, made the same point, saying that
 if consumers knew the true cost of electricity, they would conserve more.

 Even Gov. Gray Davis seems to be backing away from his promise that rates 
would not rise.

 But San Diego consumers, once again insulated from rate increases, have 
shrugged off the crisis, in part because they have taken to heart
 the governor's oft-repeated claim that the problems are the fault of 
out-of-state power generators that need to be reined in.

 ''Ask these people if they feel safe at night,'' Pete Phelps said wryly of 
those generators. Mr. Phelps, an airline pilot, was, with his wife, Pat,
 loading a 50-gallon water heater into the back of his pickup truck at a Home 
Depot near the San Diego Sports Arena.

 Mrs. Phelps added, ''You don't know what is legitimate, who to believe.''

 So the Phelpses have done little in recent months to conserve, except 
turning off lights, as their monthly electricity bill has climbed to $130,
 from about $85, in the past two years. Their new water heater was billed as 
''energy efficient,'' and while it should save them $150 a year,
 they did not buy it with conservation in mind. ''I spill that in beer 
money,'' Mr. Phelps said.

 High prices alone cannot change consumer behavior, Mr. Navarro, the 
economist, said. If consumers, for instance, believe that turning off
 lights benefits someone other than themselves, they will feel no incentive 
to conserve. That, he said, is the situation in the Pacific Northwest,
 where many residents believe that any power they save will simply be 
diverted to hot tubs in the San Francisco suburbs.

 But in San Diego, people have gotten a particularly mixed message. To begin 
with, high rates did not last long enough to make an impact.
 Rather, the lingering impression was that legislators would step in to 
protect consumers at any cost.

 The math, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 
Energy Institute, was simple.

 ''If you go from 6 cents to 22 cents to 6 cents, then the response will be 
to weather the storm,'' Mr. Borenstein said, referring to the price
 of a kilowatt hour. ''But if it stays at 22 cents, then it makes sense for 
people to go out and invest in ways to save energy.''

 Mr. Borenstein drew a parallel to the gasoline shortages of the 1970's. At 
first, he said, motorists demonized Middle East oil producers, as
 lines of cars snaked around gasoline stations, waiting for rationed 
supplies. Only after high prices persisted did consumers begin to change
 their habits, buying more fuel-efficient cars, he said.

 Still, some San Diegans insist that they are pitching in.

 ''I have not put the heat on,'' said Ms. Thompson, the real estate agent. 
''I close my doors and put on a sweater.''

 But she has not had an energy audit of her home, a service provided by San 
Diego Gas and Electric, or bought energy-saving appliances.

 During last summer's price spike, surveys by San Diego Gas and Electric 
found that 91 percent of its 1.2 million users did not think the
 utility was being wholly honest with them about the crisis, said Stephen L. 
Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the utility's parent company.
 And there is bound to be more anger, now that the utility has requested a 
surcharge of about 16 percent in March, to pay off $450 million it
 owes its power suppliers.

 Higher rates will also make life harder for people who are just getting by. 
At a recent outdoor farmer's market in El Cajon, a working-class
 town 15 miles east of San Diego, Heidi Van Horn, a massage therapist, and 
her fiance, Bernie Herloss, a handyman, were supplementing
 their $1,200 monthly income by selling grilled bratwurst and hamburgers to 
hungry shoppers.

 For the two-bedroom apartment they share, the couple have $200 in past-due 
energy bills. Those bills hover at about $100 a month, up
 from $55 two years ago. ''We aren't one of these high-rollers who make $9 an 
hour,'' Ms. Van Horn said. ''We either pay the electricity or
 have the phone shut off.''

 Even so, she said, they do what they can to conserve, turning down the 
thermostat or turning off the occasional light. But their apartment
 building is poorly insulated. Cold wind seeps in through closed windows, and 
the heating vents are near the ceiling, where the warmth is
 wasted. Their only energy-efficient light bulb is the one that came in the 
mail from San Diego Gas and Electric.

 And the two birds and the iguana they keep, Ms. Van Horn said, would die if 
she turned off any of the three heat lamps that run
 continuously in the apartment.

 She would never consider getting rid of the pets. Ms. Van Horn said. ''They 
are family.''

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like 
to
finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to 
think
that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect
to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or
can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

We are making our imbalance worse, cumulative.  We need to update our forward position and our nomination by 4,000/day to stay in balance to entitlements.

Jeff --

Currently, having signed the confidentiality agreement in Phase II of the
GRC, I am receiving, about every two weeks, a CD with an updated ,
confidential version of their integrated rate model. I now have a collection
of about 20 of theses things.  The decision was made last February to have
me (as opposed to anyone at Enron) sign the confidentiality agreement and
receive the model while we decided what we were going to do in the
proceeding.  Now that we decided that we are not going to do anything, I was
considering contacting the appropriate PG&E attorney and getting my name
removed from the list to receive model updates and returning the ones I have
gotten to date. I wanted to make sure this was okay with you before I
proceeded.

Peter Mims is preparing a memo to me that will confirm our findings on the IP 
issues based on the contracts we have reviewed and the meeting we had 
yesterday.  I should get a copy of it today and will circulate it once it is 
finalized.  I will also prepare a list of the contracts we have reviewed.  I 
am still collecting a few agreements (Ganady Batrak's prior service agreement 
and Bob Campbells agreement) and will also be collecting copies of our 
agreements with Enron Net Works employees for review.  

With respect to the NDA's, they have all been drafted and it is my 
understanding that they were sent to our counterparties last week.  Oracle 
has already signed an NDA and I have a copy if you would like to have it.  I 
would suggest that before we have further conversations with Oracle that we 
consider asking them to also sign a non-solicitation agreement with us.  The 
NDA with Oracle is the only NDA that does not contain a non-solicitation 
provision.  

In order to facilitate getting the rest of NDA's signed as quickly as 
possible, I would suggest that Rex ask each of his contacts for the name and 
phone number of the legal counsel reviewing the agreement and I will give 
them a call and find out if they have any issues that need to be resolved.  
Obviously the i2 contract should be our priority.

FYI- I received a call from the contact at PriceWaterhouseCoopers and we will 
send him a NDA directly.

Sounds good so far.

What I want by the end of today is a complete inventory of legal contracts 
reviewed and a final risk memo completed by Enron and outside council.  We 
need to make sure we have a complete list of agreements, that they have all 
been reviewed and that any risks found are summarized in a memo and we need 
it done today so we can make sure we can keep our i2 meeting Thursday.

I also want the technology audit summary completed today for the same reasons 
as the legal audit above.  I want clear documentation that the system is 
severable, what was audited and that we know if we are going to have any 
issues upon a due diligence.

I also want a completed update of the NDA list by this afternoon.  What stage 
we are in, if there are issues, etc.  We need the i2 NDA signed today.  We 
will cancel the meeting with them Thursday if it is not signed and in our 
hands very soon.  I would like the Oracle one done in the next few days and 
the IBM one done as soon as possible.  

Let's meet at the end of today to finalize these three issues.

I will see you at 2 PM for the demo.

Thanks.

Hi Everybody,
?
As of February 20th, my work schedule is changing  again.
I'll be working from 8a.m. to 4:30p.m. at NCS, and from 6p.m.  to 10p.m. at 
ACT.? If you want to get a hold of me during the week, the  best time to call 
is between 5p.m. and 5:30p.m. or between 10:30p.m. and  11:00p.m.
?
? I don't promise that I can talk for very long at these  times (especially 
not at the 5:00 interval), but if you have a quick question  for me, or some 
information to pass along, those are the times you can do  it.
?
If you want to have a more substantial conversation, you can  reach me on the 
weekend.? After putting in a 60 hour week, I tend to sleep  a little late on 
Saturday.? I suggest calling after 11a.m. if you want a  cheerful, alert 
response.? And of course,? you can always reach me by  email.
?
Phil"

Rod, per our discussion recently, I've drafted up some language to be 
included in ETS approval authority guidelines in the event that projects 
overrun their initially approved amounts:

Once capital projects are approved (whether included in the Plan or not), 
spending is limited to the approved level. If a project is projected to 
overrun, proper approval authority must be obtained prior to expending or 
committing to anything over the approved amount. In no case, can anything be 
spent over the approved amount without obtaining additional approval.

To determine the appropriate approval level needed, add the expected overrun 
to the originally approved amount. Then go to the appropriate section (ie 
projects not approved in the Plan or projects approved in the Plan) and 
identify the appropriate approval level for the new total. For example, if a 
capital project was approved in the Plan for $1.8MM and it is projected to 
overrun by $.2MM, the ETS President can approve the overrun. However, if the 
original amount were $1.9MM in the Plan and is expected to overrun by $.2MM, 
the ETS President cannot approve. It must go to the GPG CEO. Further, if the 
project's new total exceeds the GPG CEO authority, the decision will be made 
at that level when and how to obtain approval from Enron's Office of the 
Chairman.

Are you here?  I wanted to get those Intergen consents done and out of the 
way.  Also, DDuran needs to sign the Northwestern guaranty (Oz signed but 
they want more copies), and I thought it would be best if you initialled.

Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF 
+.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.

The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on 
CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover 
the ANR variable cost plus $.02.

John,

I just realized that I didn't return your call on Friday.  I ran out of the 
office on Friday after two difficult days and had Cathy collect all my stuff 
for my trip.  Jeff and I landed in Singapore last night at 1am (it is odd 
leaving for the airport on Sat. morning and arriving on Monday morning) and 
are in the office for a while this afternoon.  I'll give you a call a little 
bit later.  If your call is urgent, please don't hesitate to give me a 
voicemail if our time zones don't match up.
Thanks and sorry for the delay.

Louise 

Here is the offending piece from the SFA.  As you will see, it is not a 
binding piece of regulation, but merely a non-binding ""Discussion Paper"".  In 
fact it is even less binding than ""Consultation"" documents (also non-binding) 
which SFA put out following the discussion phase.

It does, however, provide some insight into how the SFA might regulate 
systems in the future.

I get about one of these a day from SFA and must say I missed this one.  I 
will ask our external counsel (Linklaters) to watch out for any SFA 
publications which may be relevant to Enron Online going forward and to bring 
them to our attention.  I suggest Justin and Edmund also stress this to any 
other external English counsel who may be advising us on Online.

Ken and Kevin,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a ""living"" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

With all of your history on these businesses, I thought you might be 
interested in our approach and description.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian


All games are on Wednesday nights at Jaycee Park ballfield
9/6 8:30pm vs. Raiders
9/13 7:30pm vs. Jay Ballers
9/20 8:30pm vs. Organized Confusion

As you are aware, the Corporate American Express credit cards have been cancelled, effective December 4, 2001.  We are working with American Express to establish new contracts for ETS employees. This will allow for reinstatement of service and a requirement for issuance of new cards.  We are expecting an answer from American Express on December 14, 2001.

Until advised, please limit travel and entertainment expenses.  If you are required to travel on business, you will need to use your personal credit cards or cash and submit your expenses through the XMS expense account system at:  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .   If the use of a personal credit card to cover your travel needs is not an option, cash advances can be approved by your immediate supervisor, and processed through your local administrative team.  In Houston, all cash advance requests, after obtaining proper approval, should be routed to Carolyn Centilli for processing. 

We will continue to update you of program changes as we continue to work with American Express.  If you have questions, please call Mary Ann Johnson - 713-345-5278 or Bruce Martin - 713-345-6527.

Entire story:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1117/1279805.html


Leading rusher Correll Buckhalter is among three rookie players suspended
for one game by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid on Saturday after a
Friday night incident in which the trio was taken into custody on possible
drug charges.

None of the players will participate in Sunday's game at Dallas, nor will
they be allowed to even make the trip, as the result of the team action.

ESPN.com has learned that safety Terrence Carroll, an undrafted free agent
from Oregon State, is the only one of the players who will be charged. The
players were stopped Friday night as they drove on South Street, a trendy
area of shops and clubs, and police detected an odor of marijuana.

Carroll is expected to be charged with marijuana possession and he remains
in custody pending bond. Buckhalter and cornerback Darrel Crutchfield, an
undrafted free agent from Clemson, were released on Saturday morning and
will not face charges. Carroll was to have been deactivated for the game at
Dallas and might not have made the trip anyway.

""We are obviously aware of the incident involving three of our first-year
players last night in Philadelphia,"" said Reid in a statement released by
the club. ""I've met with the players that I could meet with this morning and
they will be suspended for this Sunday's game. . . . We will not have any
further comment on this matter and we will handle the rest of this situation
internally.""

The players will each be docked $12,294, the equivalent of one game check
based on their rookie minimum base salaries of $209,000. More significant
for Carroll is that he almost certainly will be in violation of the NFL's
personal conduct policy and may also have violated the substance abuse
policy.

A fourth-round draft choice from Nebraska, the hard-running Buckhalter has
rushed for 428 yards and two touchdowns on 92 carries this year, starting
several games in place of the injured Duce Staley. Although Staley has
returned to the starting lineup, and had his best game of the season last
week, Buckhalter is still a key part of the Eagles offense.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Shaking the head here.   Bottom line is this has a positive effect on
Staley.

Thanks to Footballguy Mike Green for pointing me to this one.

Joe

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=

basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

Vince,
Steve Leppard informed my today that he will be moving to Enron Metals.  I 
think that leaves a leadership hole in Research here.  When that happens in a 
place like this, resources get diverted to the squeakiest wheel.  Do you have 
any advice?  I am concerned that London continues to lag behind in the 
implementation and analysis of VaR - most commodities are on spreadsheets and 
there is not a lot of attention on calibration, analyzing output, refining, 
improving etc..
pls advise

On the various matters currently before the California PUC:
The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference 
between DWR's cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically 
in effect.  (The order only applies, however, to the power purchased under 
the Governor's emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power.)
The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission 
that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order 
altogether, but if the Commission didn't want to vacate the order, it would 
need to change the decision so that the IOUs don't eat any shortfalls.
The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses.  In 
addition, it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a 
regularly scheduled business meeting next week.  So the opportunity to act 
and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it.
With respect to the cost of utility generation (i.e., retained generating 
assets and QF contracts), the Commission has a set up a schedule that 
foresses a Commission decision adopting an ""interim"" procurement charge on 
March 27th.  There is another ""workshop"" scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
the utilities' proposals, after which the utilities will be required to file 
formal ""advice  letters"" with the Commission.  Those advice letters will form 
the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at 
a decision on the 27th.
Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that  customers will 
see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that 
DWR incurs to buy power.  Everyone participating in the workshops also takes 
the view that customers will be on the hook for DWR's costs and the 
Commission will, if necessary, raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole.  
(Unfortunately, the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that 
it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops.  And until there is 
clarity on whether the Commission will agree to ""pass through"" those costs, 
Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWR's credit as it 
applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week.)
Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started 
to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays, i.e., the 
utilities financial position, TURN's proposal to ""net out"" the utilitities' 
generation-related revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap, 
the date on which the rate has (or will) end, etc.    Recently, TURN modified 
its testimony in response to the passage of AB1X.  TURN's new position is 
that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February 1st, 
the effective date of AB1X.   EES will need to quickly determine how and if 
it wants to respond to TURN's latest stance on the end of the rate freeze.
We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA 
customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities' 
stranded generating assets.  That compensation could come in one of two 
forms:  1) access to a proportionate share of the utilities' retained, 
cost-based generating assets, or 2) a credit representing the difference 
between the ""market"" value of the retained generating assets and the book 
value of those assets.  We are not getting much traction thus far.
The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate 
freeze issue, the issue of whether to net out generating-related revenues 
against the undercollection, etc. on March 27.  So both sets of issues (the 
procurement charges and the ""end of the rate freeze) are scheduled to be 
""finalized"" on March 27, albeit in separate orders.
With respect to the Block Foward issue, our lawyers had a pretty good meeting 
on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers.  However, it 
has become clear that despite those efforts, FERC's decision on ""charge 
backs"" will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward 
issue.

Best,
Jeff"

?That is extremely bush league, to make a change at this hour. 

I arranged my schedule around a 3:00 pm Wood meeting in SF and now am 
committed to an East Bay meeting in the morning. I may be able to make it 
there by 11:30 or noon.

Hi folks,  We're looking for something to do on this
sweltering day such that we don't have to leave our
airconditioned bedroom.  Thought you'd all like to see
what Maddie's been up to lately.  As you can see in
some of the pics, she cut herself under her right eye
falling down the stairs in front of our house.  She's
posing in front of the offending bricks in one photo.
She's fine and hopes you all haven't fallen down any
stairs recently.

The Lessers

How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to 
hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to 
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, 
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the 
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand 
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the 
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still 
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe 
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers 
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's 
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings 
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their 
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because 
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob 
Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and 
handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with 
you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, 
potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can 
fill you in on the details in that situation.  

Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?

Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial 
confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have 
been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the 
most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not 
happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation 
went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is 
there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the 
financial confirmations to Calgary.

Peggy,

As far as I can tell, we simply screwed up on this deal.  Diane Anderson, who 
was covering for Angie last week, was using my name to sign off on some other 
Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one 
by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to 
discuss.

Thanks,

Since Dianne Seib is currently on vacation, I am reviewing the financial 
confirms.  For the referenced confirm, the status is currently showing 'Sent 
to Counterparty"", although our records show that we have not yet approved the 
revised confirm.  Can you check on this for me and let me know whether this 
was sent prior to receiving Calgary's approval?  If you have any questions, I 
can be contacted at ext. 6753.

Christi,
=09As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard =
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being =
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential consequ=
ences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, then we =
may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission market=
, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach as =
was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO Coordina=
tion (Seams) Conference:

""Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard ta=
riff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing diffe=
rent proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single mark=
et model.""

=09In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for eith=
er filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a ""feet to=
 the fire"" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for =
a standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we sho=
uld specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission ri=
ghts issue, for instance, a simple ""don't allocate"" solution won't work.  T=
he lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the la=
ck of information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed=
 suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be p=
ressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power. =20

=09It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tarif=
f without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not i=
s a moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a rec=
ord.  There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome=
 of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a prett=
y good record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of good=
ies such as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a =
distinct risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is g=
iven blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge up=
hill battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on curr=
ent  RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rule=
making creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule c=
uts off options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior =
to the issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On t=
he other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued=
.  This also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies si=
tting on their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, w=

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while mayb=
e the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and ado=
pt everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the I=
SO being required to provide much greater information on where the congesti=
on occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic=
 nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to =
all the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the =
information about congestion from the past several years, they could essent=
ially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade ""above"" the=
 underlying FTRs as financial instruments.

Jim,

=09I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the ""Adopt PJM""=
 approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion =
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as =
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized=
 approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time chan=
ging horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of governmen=
t.

=09The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation=
 problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -=
- none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the=
 biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the=
 nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

=09During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that=
 a centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PN=
W) with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectri=
c and thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro=
-thermal operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW o=
perations and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commit=
ment.  Given other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the =
paper and its examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant=
 to endorse a centralize unit commitment implementation.

Steph:  Exactly what are you looking for - I'm not sure we could give you an opinion of the mechanics.  If you remember, we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the e-mail message below.  Since then, FERC has issued orders in Docket No. RP00-241 on 3/28/2001 and 6/11/2001 which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below.  There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted, namely, if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PG&E market, and the original shipper wants it back, it can re-recall the recalled capacity on 24 hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity.  If you need something more ""legal"", we'll see what we can do.  If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion, there would be a charge since they'd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one.

Subject:	Re: block II  

I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues -- namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock.  The 4/14/00 order should have taken care of it, except for El Paso's position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they weren't overselling it.  

Order Date	Block II Rulings	
6/14/2000 Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law	Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of 4/14/00 order.	
4/14/2000 Order on Rehearing (Enron)	Clarifies the January 19 order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PG&E turnback capacity, including Block II, for primary delivery to delivery points other than PG&E Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points.	
1/19/2000 Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions  (Enron & Williams)	Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PG&E Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points. Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions, which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal (see 10/19/99, 7/29/99, 9/17/98 and 6/11/98 orders) and provide (1) that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle, (2) that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PG&E Topock, and (3) if so recalled, it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PG&E service territory upon 24 hours notice. Clarifies, as in Dynegy, that the shipper (Enron) must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity, but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first.	
10/19/1999 Order on Rehearing and Clarification (Dynegy)	Denies rehearing of 7/29/99 order 	
7/29/1999 Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing (Dynegy)	 Affirms that PG&E and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract [to Dynegy]. Reverses previous ruling -- does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled. Per Settlement, recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less.  If for more than one month, the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper. On 24 hours notice, the existing shipper (i.e., Dynegy) may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets, capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers, even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate. Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California, [Dynegy] may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it.	
9/17/1998 Letter Order on Compliance Filing	Requires the Dynegy/El Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement. Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled -- issue is markets served, not delivery points. Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines.	
6/11/1998 	Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by [Dynegy]. Block II is recallable if [Dynegy] is using it to serve end users not within PG&E's service territory. Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PG&E's service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper.

Subject:	Block III Recall Rights

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

This is a very helpful memo.  I think you've hit the highlights of what we 
need to do.  We will take the lead on the five page presentation.  As for 
item #1, I agree.  Sarah will have a better idea on Tuesday what resources we 
need in DC.  As for the regional folks, I think we do want to balance time 
spent in DC with time spent on item #2.  Both are important.  Use of outside 
counsel will also need to be judged as we move forward.   As for #3, we are 
organizing the outreach here.  We clearly have much more to do on that 
front.  Janel is putting together a list of companies who might be interested 
in joining a NE RTO support coalition.  We will work with these groups to 
coordinate a message.  Two final thoughts.  1) We need to organize a similar 
effort for the Southeast, where I suspect state opposition will be even 
stronger, and 2) We need to coordinate closely on all documents used in these 
proceedings or with outside policy makers.  It is important that we have 
careful internal review.  Thanks for taking the lead on coordinating our game 
plan.

		 Subject: Northeast RTO Strategy

I wanted to bring try and coordinate our activities on the Northeast RTO.

1. FERC Mediation Process -- My recommendation is that Sarah Novosel is 
anointed Lead.  I don't know that we need to have every regional ISO person 
at all of the meetings.  I think that Sarah should consider her needs and 
make the call on other's participation.  Also, I would leave it up to Sarah 
to include or not include outside legal counsel.  This is going to be the 
focal point, but not the only place where this issue is discussed heavily.

2. State Political Support -- The key to any successful outcome is to have 
the key regulatory and political leaders in each state impacted by FERC's 
decision to support the formation of a single market and RTO.  Right now I 
don't think that we have pushed this agenda.  My recommendation is that NY, 
PA, NJ, and MA are the key places to focus (maybe NH and MD).  We need a 
strong and constant message in to the PUCs and Governor's offices that 
everyone wins under this Order.  Makes sense to me to have a small traveling 
band rove through these locations to build support.  Maybe need to beef up 
our lobbying presence in Harrisburg and Albany to get this done?

3. Congressional Political Support -- What is the current temperature of the 
Northeast delegation?  Have we messaged the ""upside"" of this action by FERC?  
What do Sen. Schumer and Sen. Clinton think?  Who else will take this on?  
One potential argument for the naysayers may be an environmental argument 
that this will result in more pollution in the Northeast, although FERC has 
dealt with this in the 888 context.  

My fear is that we are not providing enough air cover for Sarah at FERC.  
Getting Gov. Pataki and Gov. Ridge to state publicly that this is the ""right"" 
thing would be huge (even better to include Sen. Clinton).

Finally, can Sarah Novosel and the ISO team (Dan A, Howard, Tom H.)  build a 
short 5 page presentation that outlines the benefits of a single RTO that we 
can use on the road show and up on Capitol Hill?  They have the best 
knowledge to do this.

If people want a conference call, I'm in today and tomorrow.

Jim

Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 2002 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 2002 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the roll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.   

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommending for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or concerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.

Have also today spoken to Anthony Duenner, finally.  I am afraid the message 
for David is that we should be thinking about his exit.  I cannot see much 
mileage in putting him in front of Cliff.  Do you agree that we should be 
discussing exit package?   thanks  mcs

Mark,

Thanks for your note.  It's a common misconception that we will be mostly 
working on asset disposition.  Our focus will be on the efficient operation 
of the assets, cleaning up problems, finishing projects etc.  The sales 
efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxter's group with support from us.  
So, I don't believe that  I will need the type of effort that you believe 
David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture.  Cliff 
may feel that he has the need for David.  By the way, my experience with 
David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the 
business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were 
restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Rebecca

Subject: regulatory support

With your new organisation, I expect that you will have issues that will 
require support from my team, covering everything outside the Americas (Rick 
Shapiro providing support in the Americas).  Any thoughts either of you have 
regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful.  My understanding 
is that a fair bit of your effort will be focussed on asset disposition.  If 
that is correct, I want to run one idea by you.  We still have David Merrill 
posted as an expat in Singapore.  He is not working out as support for EBS 
(totally new field to him).  What are your thoughts on David returning to the 
energy arena, and focussing on flying around, as appropriate, to meet with 
various governments, working to secure necessary approvals, as/when/if 
needed?  Seems to fit his skill sets, based on prior government experience 
that he has.  

A second person who could also fill this role, though he is looking at other 
opportunities within Enron and may not be available, is Mike Dahlke.  
Thoughts on this person for this role?

It's a great pleasure to have you visiting us and a great honor to have
dinner with you. I'd like to thank you for your wonderful presentation. It's
the most interesting topic we had so far. This is not just my personal
opinion, all my classmates I talked to agree with me.  I like Enron's style

Subject:	Market Opening Initiatives

Just to update you on some initiatives we will be undertaking over the next several months re market opening:


continued contact with the Government side of the Legislature and  key civil service personnel re pros/cons of  market opening dates under consideration (I will likely ask you both  and Garrett Tripp to attend some of these meetings depending on audience and subject).

contact with key personnel in Liberal caucus and staff to explain why it is important that market opening proceed in early 2002 ( a contact program is under way and I will likely be asking you both and Garrett Tripp to attend some of these meetings):  our sense is that Liberals will not cause the Gov't problems on this issue and the object here is to ensure that this remains the case.

broader Province wide media effort - Richard Shapiro is committed to spending the week beginning October 8 in Ontario - he and I will be spending the week visiting/talking to media outlets across the Province about why Ontario must proceed with competition in in early 2002.  I do not yet have the details of that ""tour"" but will provide them as soon as they are available.

contact with trade associations (not just the big ones like AMPCO etc. but the smaller less obvious ones like the independent grocers) with a view to explaining the benefits of competition  and, in the best case, possibly replicating commercial opportunities comparable to that which has developed with the CFIG. Work is already under way on this and  I would suggest that Jeff Borg work with me. 

coordination, where possible and appropriate, with other stackholders such as TH, BE, TransAlta, Direct etc. As you know, those opportunities are going to be discussed at a meeting at TH next Tuesday morning.  In my view, what is key is ensuring consistency of messaging re an early market opening, though there should  be an  opportunity  to jointly fund a public education campaign re the benefits of competition (given that the gov't appears reluctant to do this itself).

Attached are clean and redline versions of the ""without margining"" master netting agreement.  The redline is   
just for your review to discern the changes.  
I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow.
Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

ok girls...sue, haven't called you bk yet w/ the 411, and kates, haven't
heard back from you after i left the past couple messages, so this could end
up being a collosal disaster, but went ahead and made reservations at Garson
for 7:45 tonight.  it's on hillcroft btwn westheimer and 59...super scary
area on ""wrong"" side of westeimer, but have reliable sources who've raved,
and since was close to Hart, have driven past several times and looked safe,
  persian food, which is i'm not exactly sure what.....but supposed to have
good meze, kebabs, and persian ice cream.  hope y'all are in.  could be
supremely embarrsaing to dine solo in semi-formal middle eastern restaurant
w/ no bar....luby's or cafe express is one thing....a belly dancer's haunt
is quite another!  chat soon, mes amis...

Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies.

Vicky,

Sounds like they've been working you to hard.  You certainly deserve a vacation.  I would like to hear about your adventures overseas.  My address is as follows:


			Andy Lewis
			3131 Timmons Ln
			Apt. 1010	
			Houston, TX  77027



I got a letter from Diem with their new London address.  I figure I'll give them a month or so to move in  before I look into visiting.  Of course, getting time off in this job is easier said than done.  Anyway, enjoy your trip, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Per conversation with christian, and prior discussions with cadwalader i 
think the memo of cad is off on cross default too.  i had noted such on my

To signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement:

ALJ Biren has given us until Friday of this week (April 28, 2000) to file
""errata"" to the Comprehensive Settlement.

So far, I am planning to make the following non-substantive changes:

1.  The table of contents was seriously messed up by an ""automatic update""
feature in Word just before we duplicated and filed.  I will be putting it
back to the state you saw in the final draft.

2.  On p.7, section 1.12, put a period at the end of the last sentence.

3.  On p.9, section 1.1.3.1,  two thirds of the way down the page, I will be
changing ""subject to adjustment annual by the base rate PBR formula"" to
""subject to adjustment annually by the base rate PBR formula"".

4. On p.27, section 1.5.4, in the third full paragraph on the page, I will
be changing ""If only one customer has an OFO day"" to ""If only one customer
class has an OFO day"".

5.  Also on p.27, section 1.5.4, bottom line on the page, I will be filling
in the blank with ""C"" (so it reads ""Appendix C"")


In the category of ""maybe substantive"",

1.  On p.10, section 1.1.3.2, three lines from the bottom of the page, the
date ""October 1, 2000"" would be changed to ""October 1, 2001"".  This sentence
refers to including the cost of backbone transmission for core customers
buying gas from SoCalGas in the ""procurement"" rate.  Obviously, our intent
was to do that only once we had unbundled backbone transmission, which
happens on October 1, 2001.


In the category of ""substantive"":

1.  Our capacity term sheet had said that we would unbundled ""additional""
(non-reliability) storage for CTAs effective upon implementation of the
settlement (See p.4).  The filed settlement managed to drop the section that
provided for this option for CTAs prior to the principal storage change on
April 1, 2001.  (The filed settlement is ok for the period starting April 1,
2001).  So, to be consistent with the term sheet, we need to insert
something back into the settlement to allow CTAs to opt out of
non-reliability storage in the period from the effective date (90 days after
approval) to April 1, 2001.  Obviously, this may not be a very long period.
John Leslie has suggested inserting at the very beginning of Section
5.4.4.3:  ""In the partial storage year beginning on the effective date of
this Settlement Agreement, and....[continue with current text].""  We would
need to cover as part of implementation filings the exact mechanism/pricing
for SoCalGas purchasing gas in storage owned by CTAs if they opt out of
nonreliability storage prior to April 1. 2001.  SoCalGas and SDG&E are ok
with John's language and want to make sure it is ok with other signatories.


If you have any problems with any of these changes, please contact me or
Brian Cherry by noon on Friday, April 28.  My email is gsullivan@sempra.com
and my phone is (619) 699-5162.  Brian's email is bcherry@sempra.com and
phone is (213) 244-3895.

We are looking at the possibility of two or three additional changes, and
Brian may send you a follow-up message.

Forget the greenhouse requirements and  just make it requirements up to 50

Also, the GTC method is fine with me.

Janet,
 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by ""Greenhouse 
requirements""?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm

			Good Wednesday Morning - Comments From The Local
Guys!

Yesterday, we received revised numbers on first quarter productivity, which
came in at -1.2% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis. On a
year-over-year basis, productivity remains at a relatively healthy 2.5%
rate, although this is half the pace at which it was running less than one
year ago. A slowdown in productivity is not unusual during an economic
slowdown. Corporations face fixed costs, while business is declining.
Unfortunately, that is why there are layoffs. With lower corporate costs,
productivity should improve as the economy picks up steam. Tomorrow, the
market will be receiving the weekly initial jobless claims, which are
expected to remain near last week's level. Lehman Brothers' economists look
for first-time unemployment insurance filings to total 415,000 for the week
ended Saturday, June 2.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.65%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.25%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.83%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.44 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.85 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

*We are upgrading PG to a Buy (2) rating based upon what we perceive as a
good trading opportunity in front of their June 15 outlook
meeting. We expect the meeting to highlight (1) more aggressive actions to
reduce PG's asset base than previously telegraphed; (2)
expect FY 02's recurring earnings growth to be confirmed at the
consensus-implied 6-8% rates and (3) expect previously stated long-term
growth targets to remain in place.
*Cost cutting /right-sizing remains the theme for the balance of the
calendar year / majority of FY 02. A very focused effort will
improve PG's competitiveness, but there is a reasonable probability PG will
exceed the previously telegraphed $400-$800 M in
incremental restructuring charges in order to further accelerate the
restructuring process.
*PG is slowly shifting its attention to sales growth but 4-6% long-term
growth is at least one fiscal year out. Maximum upside is
$72.00 absent any earnings-enhancing news.

OLD NEW STREET P/E

FY: 8/31 Price Target $27 $27
Rank 1 3
*We are lowering our rating on National Service Industries' stock to 3
(Market Perform) from 1 (Strong Buy) based on valuation. The
stock has increased 37% since we initiated coverage on September 27, 2000,
outperforming a 10% drop in the S&P 500, and is near
our $27 price target. At about $26, NSI's stock trades at 13 times est.
fiscal (August) 2001 EPS of $2.00, and 11 times est. 2002 EPS
of $2.30. We do not see significant upside in the stock price from current
levels, and believe the shares will move with the market in
the near-term rather than outperform.
*We continue to expect difficult earnings comparisons for the second half of
2001, with a flattish 3Q (May) and a lower 4Q compared
with the prior year level. For the full year 2001, we expect lower earnings
in all segments: lighting, chemicals, linen rental, and
envelope. The risk to earnings going forward is a worse than expected drop
in non-residential construction impacting the company's
lighting business. Also, a drop in consumer spending would impact the linen
rental business.

Power 	D. Ford, .212.526.0836
No, The Sky is NOT Falling
*A change in investor sentiment towards the wholesale market has resulted in
a sell-off in the energy merchant stocks. We believe this
sell-off has been overdone and would recommend buying shares of Aquila,
Dynegy and Mirant.
*In our opinion, the apparent change in sentiment has been the result of
three factors: 1) a sector shift into tech stocks; 2) increased
perceived political risks on both the federal and state levels; and 3)
concerns about the potential for contracting commodity prices and
margins.
*While we do not see any catalysts that will stem this flow in the
near-term, we believe that preannouncement and upside earnings
surprises are just around the corner.
*Our favorite picks are energy merchants: Aquila, Dynegy and Mirant.

Mkt Cap: $11.4B EPS 2002 -$3.19E -$3.19E -$3.15E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $28 $28
Rank 2 2
*With the stock approaching all time lows, we believe positives outweigh
negatives here, and stock offers good near term upside.
*While long term challenges remain, such as dependence on IRUs for
growth/funding, GX is off 24% in last two weeks, is making
good progress in Commercial and is a clear leader in the bandwidth sector.
We believe there is good near term upside. In terms of
DCF valuation, we get to $15-$20/share, even haircutting our (below
guidance) #'s by 20%.
*GX has signed >$600M in Commercial contracts year-to-date, and Comm Svcs
grew 7% seq, in Q1, and should grow 9%+ in Q2.
*The subsea market is rationalizing, and the 4 major subsea players could
become 2 over next 12 mos.
*Long-term challenges include IRU sales, and 01 guidance may prove
aggressive, though we believe that is in the stock, and we
believe the company can hit our 01 Cash Rev number of $6.71B, +30% Y-Y.

McDonald's Corp(MCD) 1 - Strong Buy M. Speiser, .212.526.3255
McREIT? New tax ruling could spark spec of REIT spin-off
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $29.41 EPS 2000 N/A $1.46 N/A N/A

FY: 12/31 Price Target $38 $38
Rank 1 1
*A favorable IRS tax ruling on REITs can spark speculation that MCD can
unlock value by spinning-off its multi-billion dollar real
estate portfolio. With a new CFO to be appointed, this can further fuel
speculation. Reit 1-Strong Buy
*The IRS has reversed a tax ruling on treatment of REITs; this will present
oppty's for co's with lots of real estate, like MCD, to spin-off
real estate b/c it could now be done on a tax-free basis
*In the US, MCD has about $8bil of property & equipment & earned $1.4b of
rental income in 00
*The risk is the elimination of a steady income stream. But, the value of a
REIT is the tax benefit & higher Returns to MCD; lower
MCD earnings (no rental income) would be more than offset by ownership of
the REIT & its tax-free benefits
Back-of-envelope analysis yields $270mil in value ($0.20/share) due to
shifting the rental income of owned sites under franchised
stores to non-taxable status; other benefits are likely.

Addressing the Balance Sheet and Other Concerns
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $61.90 EPS 2000 N/A $2.29 N/A N/A

Mkt Cap: $29.6B EPS 2002 $2.98E $2.98E $3.00E 20.8
FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*EDS shares have underperformed the major indices and CSC shares since
reporting strong 1Q01 results. We attribute this to some
concerns around the recent acquisitions, the need to access the public
markets to finance these deals and the increase in DSO's and the
drop in cash flow reported in 1Q01.
*Late last week we had a private call with the controller of EDS to address
the balance sheet issues. We believe that the key issue is
the volume of large deals ramping in 1H01. Receivable terms on large
outsourcing deals are often extended in the early stages of
contracts. On selected large deals, we also suspect that EDS (and perhaps
others) may be offering up-front price discounts, adding to
the cash flow requirement although average margins over the life of a
contract appear stable. We do not expect DSO's to decrease
materially until perhaps 4Q01.
*At 23 times forward estimated EPS for a 15% EPS growth rate story with high
visibility, we remain comfortable with EDS and our 2-
Buy rating.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Integrated Oil P. Cheng, .212.526.1884
Weekly U.S. Crude Oil & Refined Products Inventory Summary
*Absent any new major refinery or pipeline accidents, we expect gasoline
futures to drop to below $0.80 per gallon within the next
several weeks. In addition, gasoline inventories should continue to build on
average by about 0.5-1.0 million barrels per week over
the next two months due to strong domestic output and weak demand. We
continue to recommend an underweight position in the
independent refiners group.

Paper & Forest Products P. Ruschmeier, .212.526.9898
IRS Revenue Ruling Supports Bullish Timber Thesis
*As we indicated yesterday (6/5/01), IRS revenue ruling 2001-29 has positive
implications for the pending merger between PCL and
TGP and positive implications for a structural shift in timber ownership
from C-Corps to REITs over time. We are reiterating our
favorable ratings on companies with the greatest timberland exposure
including WY, LPX, TIN, BCC, IP, BOW, & TGP.
*Yesterday (6/5/01) we learned that the IRS reversed a 1973 revenue ruling
that prevents REITs from engaging in the active conduct
of a trade or business.
*We believe the ruling is an important first step in paving the way for
timber-rich companies to transition ownership of timber cash
flow from a C-corp. structure to a tax-advantaged REIT structure.
*We believe the ruling supports a favorable outcome to the PCL/TGP merger.

Internet Healthcare R. Rouse, .212.526.7347
MORE CRO UPSIDE - THE BIOTECHS ARE COMING !!!
*The CROs are poised to take advantage of two significant trends that we
pose are underway: 1. the much anticipated ""biotech bulge""
may be upon us sooner than expected (a long-term catalyst); and 2. this is
in addition to our previous call for efficiency gains and
margin upside given a return to normalized late-stage trial volume (a
near-term catalyst).
*Proprietary pipeline analysis and industry anecdotes lead us to the
proposition that the beginning of a wave of novel drugs is entering
clinical development. This creates bottlenecks for drug sponsors and
opportunities for service vendors. Diversified CROs (CVD,
PPDI, & QTRN) and niche providers (AAII & ARRY) could reap benefits as early
as this year while those more clinically focused
(KNDL & PRXL) could see upside by the end of next year.

Insurance/Life E. Berg, .212.526.2805
Estate Tax Reform: With New Focus Any Damage Will Be Minor
*An effort by us to quantify the impact on life insurers of the change in
the Federal estate-tax law passed last week by Congress is
leading us to affirm our 1-Strong Buy ratings on Manulife, Nationwide, and
John Hancock.
*The bottom line to our analysis: While these three life insurers and others
could lose as much as one-third of their existing estate-tax-oriented
policies and growth in new sales of estate-tax-oriented life insurance could
also slow by a third its still not a big deal. The
entire loss, between existing and new policies combined, would translate
only into about a 5 % to 10 % loss of revenues and earnings
companywide because estate planning is only a portion of their business.

Rank 3 3
*ABS is just beginning the arduous process of a turnaround, with a new CEO
that is willing and able to lead. He is evaluating every
aspect of the business, and is prepared to right size the company through
divestitures of profitable assets that have weak long-term
prospects.
*ABS reported 1Q01 EPS of $0.46, $0.01 ahead of our estimates and consensus.
Sales were in line with our estimates, but the
operating margin deteriorated by only 39 bp versus the 60 bp we had
forecast.
*We have lowered our 2Q01 estimate from $0.47 to $0.45, and our FY02
estimates from $1.96 to $1.93.
*With our new lower estimate, ABS' stock is trading at a 2001 P/E 14.4x, a
mere 1.5 multiple point discount to KR, which we rate a 1-
Strong Buy ($24.78). We think this gap is too narrow given the differences
in earnings outlook and asset quality, so we are
maintaining our 3-Market Perform rating

I went by the store on my way home and saw a Pillsbury mix with red and green 
confetti in it - decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies.  Since 
it was after 10:00 when I got started on this project, it turned out be a 
good decision.  I would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for 
the family next week that I can use it.

Attached herewith please find Chairman Bliley's letter to his House Commerce 
Committee members outlining the process and content for full committee 
mark-up upon Congress' return from the July 4th break; the section-by-section 
on transmission plus the actual transmission legislative language are also 
attached.  H.R. 2944 is the underlying bill to which these changes are made.

We have made substantial progress just this week.  We will need to be 
diligent to determine which amendments will be offered in July and to guard 
against those we oppose.  Commerce Committee members are continuing their 
meetings this evening to further plan the upcoming mark-up.

The Senate Reliability bill will likely not be considered until Congress 
reconvenes in July.  Several Democrat Senators have now placed holds.  Under 
the Senate Rules, just one Member can block bill consideration under the hold 
process.  At this point, the hold is process vs. substance.

July will be the most critical month in order for us to realize bill 
enactment this Congress.

How are things in Denver?  I haven't heard from you in a while and I thought 
I would drop you a line.  I have the picture of all of us from that mexican 
food restaurant off of Westheimer under my mouse pad and I was thinking about 
you.

How are the wedding plans going?  Good I hope.  Have you adjusted to the new 
living situation?  It can be tough at first, but as long as you are patient, 
everything works out.  That was probably the most difficult thign for us.  

Have you been keeping up with the Astros?  They look absolutely horrible.  
They blew another 7 run lead last night.  At least the stadium is really 
nice, otherwise I would be very dissappointed that I got tickets.  I hope 
your parents are still enjoying the seats. 

Talk to you soon.

Paul/Alan,

We need to have someone check into the legal issues associated with our 
trading equities in each of the respective countries we are interested in 
trading.  We need to get rulings on shares, futures and options for both 
exchange traded and over the counter activity for each country.  This 
""research"" should be performed in much the same way as when we began trading 
in Australia.  Some of the countries involved may have already been ""green 
lighted"" a few years ago.  The countries we need to look into initially are:

Germany
France
Italy
Norway
Netherlands
Spain
United Kingdom


Once we get feedback on these countries we should continue on to secondary 
countries which include:

Austria
Belgium
Denmark
Ireland
Israel
Sweden
Switzerland
Portugal
Turkey


I will leave up to yourselves to decide where this project should be 
coordinated from but as we are a US coporate and ECT Investments, the 
principal booking entity, is a US entity I would imagine it should be handled 
from the States.  Please let me know if anyone has any questions or would 
like to discuss issues associated with this request. 

Thanks and regards,
John

   Texas May Face a Glut of Electricity, But It Won't Help in the Rest of U=
.S. Pride and Policy Make State a Magnet For Power Plants and an Island Unt=
o Itself By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVOand RUSSELL GOLD  Staff Reporters of THE WALL=
 STREET JOURNAL While California struggles to keep its lights on and New Yo=
rk City braces for possible electricity shortages this summer, Texas utilit=
ies could soon face the opposite problem: a power glut.   Texas' wide-open =
spaces and relatively weak zoning and environmental rules have helped make =
the Lone Star state a magnet for power-generation companies as it prepares =
to deregulate its electricity market next year. The result: Texas' electric=
ity-production capacity this summer is expected to exceed its peak power de=
mand by 11,000 megawatts -- nearly enough to light up New York City. By the=
 summer of 2002, the excess may be closer to 15,000 megawatts, enough to po=
wer 15 million homes. And with 27 new generating plants under construction,=
 more than any other state, some power producers fear that overbuilding ult=
imately could send Texas' wholesale electricity prices into a tailspin. A G=
rid Apart All this sounds like good news for the electricity-starved East a=
nd West Coasts -- but it isn't. That's because the U.S. is divided into thr=
ee major power grids -- with the West on one, the East on another and most =
of Texas on a third, with very few links to the rest of the country. In the=
 world of electricity, that makes Texas ""an island with a couple of little =
footpaths over to it,"" says Larry Makovich, senior director for electric po=
wer research at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Cambridge, Mass., c=
onsulting firm. Some Texas utility executives argue that their state's isla=
nd status is principally an accident of geography. But no one disputes the =
fact that good old Texas pride -- and a deep-seated skepticism toward feder=
al regulation -- also played a role in shaping the state's grid. So, too, d=
id a renegade utility's desperate 1976 bid to save itself from a corporate =
breakup and the resulting four-year legal battle, which the industry later =
dubbed the ""Texas Range War."" Texas' isolation isn't expected to end anytim=
e soon. If Texas became fully interconnected, its big utilities say, the st=
ate could become more susceptible to blackouts, if other regions drew off t=
oo much power. ""From a reliability standpoint, it would be a degradation to=
 the Texas grid,"" says Steve Schaeffer, a senior vice president at Reliant =
Energy  Inc., the former Houston Lighting & Power Co. Competing Interests M=
oreover, the utilities estimate that building the transmission lines needed=
 for a full connection to the nation's other grids would take at least thre=
e years and cost Texas ratepayers about $600 million. They don't want to in=
vest that much money to sell power to California or New York to ease what t=
hey view as temporary imbalances. Some in the state also believe low rates =
and excess power could give it an advantage in persuading businesses to loc=
ate there. ""America will be shy enough electricity that this will be one of=
 our greatest inducements for growing Texas,"" says Matthew Simmons, preside=
nt of Houston investment bank Simmons & Co. Texas is an extreme example of =
the haphazard way electricity grids developed in the U.S. Until the 1960s, =
most power plants were built near the customers they served. Then, utilitie=
s began building larger, more-efficient coal and nuclear plants, connecting=
 them with their neighbors to ensure that if one of these big plants went d=
own, there would be a backup ready to keep the power flowing. 'No Big Money=
' But the old-line Texas utilities, which have long benefited from the stat=
e's plentiful supplies of fuels such as natural gas and lignite coal, were =
reluctant to join in this wave of interconnections. Back then, in the mid-t=
o-late 1970s, electricity outside Texas was generally more costly. And surr=
ounding states weren't planning big enough plants to back up the huge new o=
nes Texas was building to power its fast-growing cities and energy-thirsty =
petrochemical industry. ""There was no big money to be made by shipping powe=
r one way or the other over the lines,"" says Reliant's Mr. Schaeffer. By co=
nfining their grid to Texas, state utilities also avoided oversight by the =
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Thus, FERC couldn't force Texas to se=
nd power out of state in case of an emergency. The state's dominant utiliti=
es -- Texas Utilities Inc., the Dallas-based predecessor of what is now TXU=
  Corp., and Houston Lighting -- went to great lengths to ensure there were=
 no interstate connections. The switches at a hydroelectric plant on the Te=
xas-Oklahoma border were wired to prevent power from flowing between the st=
ates. Elsewhere along the border, a system of relays was installed to preve=
nt unauthorized interstate transmissions. Only one big utility didn't like =
the setup: Central & South West Corp., a Dallas holding company that owned =
power plants in both Texas and Oklahoma. In 1976, it faced a crisis. If it =
couldn't show that its plants in both states were interconnected, it ran th=
e risk of being broken up under a federal law. The law, which barred holdin=
g companies from owning unconnected utilities in separate states, was decad=
es old. But, until then, it hadn't been strictly enforced. On May 4, 1976 -=
- eight days before the Securities and Exchange Commission was set to consi=
der the matter -- Central & South West took an extraordinary step. At 5:30 =
a.m., it sent one of its line crews to secretly rewire a substation in Vern=
on, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, allowing power to flow freely between =
the two states. For a few hours, the grids were connected by a minuscule th=
read. Later that morning, officials at Central & South West phoned other Te=
xas utilities to tell them the company was engaged in interstate commerce. =
 Texas' other major utilities reacted angrily. ""The sons of bitches are try=
ing to steal my lignite!"" Texas Utilities Chairman Louis Austin bellowed, a=
ccording to former Texas Public Utility Commissioner George Cowden, who rec=
alls Mr. Austin making the remark during a private meeting between the two =
men. Around noon, Houston Lighting cut its system off from the rest of the =
state's utilities. Texas Utilities followed suit hours later. By day's end,=
 the state's utilities had broken the grid into a half-dozen pieces. That s=
ame day, one of Texas Utilities' chief lawyers, a 6-foot-6 former college-f=
ootball star named J.A. ""Tiny"" Gooch, dispatched one of his company's crews=
 to disconnect the link Central & South West had made between Vernon and Al=
tus, Okla. ""They made it so it was physically impossible to [connect] it ag=
ain,"" says Mr. Gooch's son, Gordon, then a lawyer representing Houston Ligh=
ting. The elder Mr. Gooch, who died in 1986, is considered the patron saint=
 of Texas' electrical independence.  At an emergency meeting of the utility=
 commission three days later, Mr. Austin of Texas Utilities expressed disgu=
st at the prospect of having to burn Texas lignite and natural gas to satis=
fy ""Yankees,"" according to a transcript. And, he added: ""I don't like feder=
al regulations."" (Mr. Austin died in 1997.) A wire reputed to have formed p=
art of Central & South West's brief Texas-Oklahoma interconnection later wa=
s cut into pieces, encased in Lucite and given out as paperweights by Dalla=
s law firm Worsham, Forsythe & Woolridge, which represented Texas Utilities=
. Alan Erwin, a state utility commissioner in 1976 who still has the souven=
ir on his desk, used the wiring episode as fodder for a 1979 novel, ""The Po=
wer Exchange,"" in which a winter storm cripples Northeast power production =
and the nation turns to Texas for electricity. Texas refuses to ship the el=
ectricity, fearful that other regions would drain it of ""what little cheap =
fuel was left."" Ultimately, Texas becomes a scapegoat and ends up seceding =
from the union. Real-Life Compromise In reality, the outcome was less drama=
tic. The grid conflict wound its way through many courtrooms. Central & Sou=
th West -- recently acquired by American Electric Power  Co. of Columbus, O=
hio -- lost almost every round. After about four years, the utilities hashe=
d out a compromise, at the urging of the federal government. Rather than li=
nk the Texas grid to the East, so that electricity could flow freely across=
 state borders through alternating-current cables, they agreed to build two=
 direct-current lines. Operators could control the flow over these bridges,=
 which at peak capacity could carry a mere 820 megawatts. The parties to th=
e deal, which included the federal government, agreed these links wouldn't =
bring the Texas grid under federal jurisdiction. Today, Texas power continu=
es to be regulated in Austin, not Washington. ""It's just a Texas thing,"" sa=
ys Pat Wood III, chairman of the state utility commission and a recent Bush=
 administration nominee to FERC. ""We want control of our own destiny."" That=
 independent attitude has extended in recent years to Texas' business-frien=
dly approach to deregulating its power industry. Unlike California, with it=
s stringent emissions and zoning rules, Texas has made it quick and easy fo=
r power companies to locate their plants almost anywhere they can find a pl=
ace to hook up to the grid. Last year, Texas completed a major upgrade to a=
lleviate bottlenecks on the grid, and it has six similar projects under way=
. Unlike most other states, it decided to charge grid users a flat rate to =
move power anywhere in the state, so they could put plants in low-cost rura=
l areas, far from their customers. Those policies, as well as projections t=
hat the state's electricity demand would grow by a robust 3.5% a year, set =
off a flurry of power-plant construction, beginning in 1998. Since then, $1=
1 billion worth of power plants have been completed or started in Texas, an=
d more are on the drawing board. By contrast to California's approach to de=
regulation, which largely failed to bring new plants online, Texas' strateg=
y ""encouraged an overbuild,"" says Mr. Makovich, of Cambridge Energy Researc=
h Associates. Consider tiny Seguin in south central Texas, where Constellat=
ion Energy Group  Inc. of Baltimore is building an 800-megawatt gas-powered=
 plant in a former cornfield. Fifteen miles to the west, Texas Independent =
Energy LP of Dallas recently finished a 1,000-megawatt plant. About the sam=
e distance to the north, American National Power, a Houston-based unit of B=
ritain's International Power  PLC, is building a 1,100-megawatt plant. If g=
enerators don't get cold feet, Texas is on track to have a capacity surplus=
 of 9% this summer and 11% by summer 2002, says Cambridge Energy Research A=
ssociates. That's in addition to the 15% surplus that most experts consider=
 an adequate cushion. Some areas of the country, including parts of the Sou=
theast, Upper Midwest, New York City and the West, are struggling with razo=
r-thin capacity margins. After factoring in a similar 15% cushion, the West=
 has an 8% capacity deficit and the Upper Midwest has a 4% deficit. As a re=
sult, while electricity futures prices for summer are running at as much as=
 $400 per megawatt hour in the Northwest and around $100 in the Northeast, =
Texas futures prices are averaging only $72 to $74 per megawatt hour. Calpi=
ne  Corp. of San Jose, Calif., is making the boldest wager that overcapacit=
y and a lack of export possibilities won't sink Texas's wholesale electrici=
ty prices. The company has six plants under construction in the state, two =
of which are expected to come on line next month. And it plans to add an ad=
ditional five plants over the next two years. Altogether, Calpine plans to =
spend about $2.8 billion in the state, its largest investment outside Calif=
ornia. ""People from day one probably thought Calpine was crazy,"" says Darre=
ll Hayslip, a company vice president. ""But so far, we are absolutely convin=
ced that this is the right bet."" He says Calpine's newer gas-fired plants a=
re 40% more efficient than older plants in the state, a third of which are =
at least 30 years old. Calpine expects that edge to force rivals to retire =
older plants, thus keeping electricity prices from sagging. Duke's Doubts O=
thers aren't so sure. After initially planning new plants in Texas, Duke En=
ergy  Corp. began to worry that the state was getting overbuilt. Last May, =
Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., sold its 80% stake in a plant under construction =
in south Texas to Calpine. ""We sized up the market early, and then realized=
 too many followers were doing the same thing,"" says Jim Donnell, president=
 and CEO of Duke Energy North America. If the electricity situation outside=
 Texas grows too grim and too much supply sinks prices in the state, there =
could be ""renewed pressure"" for Texas to study interconnection options, say=
s John Stauffacher, vice president for regulatory affairs at Houston-based =
Dynegy  Inc., which has 1,000 megawatts of capacity in Texas. Calpine, for =
one, wouldn't mind sharing Texas power with the East and West. ""I would lov=
e to be able to wheel power from Texas to California,"" says Mr. Hayslip. Bu=
t, so far, the Texas utilities haven't budged in their opposition to export=
s. A few generators are trying to find the best of both worlds. Tenaska Inc=
. of Omaha, Neb., is building plants at the border between the Texas and ea=
stern grids. Though utilities aren't allowed to be connected to both grids =
at once, the plants are designed to allow the company to switch between gri=
ds as demand and prices warrant. In rural Grimes County, about 90 miles out=
side Houston, Tenaska plant manager Frank Carelli boasts that his 830-megaw=
att plant could disconnect from one grid, connect to the other and be back =
at full power within an hour. A similar Tenaska plant is slated to begin op=
erations this month in Rusk County, near the Louisiana border. =09

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Dear David,

Thanks for your message.  To make our request clearer, for the past two weeks 
we have put out a preliminary DPR every morning at 8 am our time (seen by 
commercial heads, Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, RAC, anyone with access to the 
DPR).  All groups world-wide are able to provide us preliminary figures by 7 
am our time for:

positions, 
maturity gap,
VAR, and
P&L

This is the information that we would like you to provide as well.

I understand that you have some hurdles to get over to be able to provide us 
these figures, and while you keep working to get over these hurdles, we would 
be happy if you provide us the information you are currently able to (i.e. if 
you can only provide P&L we'd like to start with that, if you can only 
provide us with one commodities information we would like to have that). 
Please remember that the information we are requesting is preliminary 
information.  We would expect that there would be some changes between what 
you give us at 7 am and the final information you give us by 11 am.

Best regards

Shona

Subject: DPR Summary

Shona,

Just to summarise the main thrust of our discussion yesterday:

Preliminary P/L due @ 1PM Local (7pm Houston)

As I understand, Sally is the sponsor of this project with the goal of 
presenting Skilling with a DPR by 8a.m. the following day.
I have asked all mgmrs to assess how we can achieve this.  We will discuss 
this in meeting early next week. 
A major obstacle that we face, is limited IT resource to re-engineer and 
expedite our processes.  This will require buy in of senior mgmt and 
commercial business heads to reallocate resources away from current projects. 
(James to discuss.)
Additionally, there are certain dependencies on depts in Houston, which are 
prerequisite for DPR completion in London. Notably Continental Power has a 
dependency on Portcalc IT support in Houston.  
Shift work and 16 hour days are more difficult (not impossible) to implement 
in London as the labour market is very tight and such working conditions 
would make Enron very uncompetitive as a prospective employer.  Bear in mind 
that we compete directly with all the big investment houses for the best 
talent.  A decision to use shift's would have to be made at the highest level 
considering the possible implications on the corporate image.  This might 
suggest that additional IT resource is the only feasible way forward.

I could easily say that we can do the preliminary p/l but I assume that we 
wish to retain the qualatitive features of our reporting.  Therefore I have 
tempered my comments to reflect what I believe are real issues that we in 
London will have to address.   We will get back to you with our proposals., 
after we have discussed these issues early next week.

Same day DPR

This is the long term goal and is such a large project that it would have to 
be sponsored at the highest level here in Europe.
James to discuss with Fernley & Mike. 


Regards,

Dave

Hello Dale,

I've added ""PJM Interconnect Peak"" load shape to the mapping table.

We need to find out which pub code to map for ""PJM Interconnection"" index 
(there are literally hundreds of pub codes available for PJM).

Here is my suggestion for the PJM Index. I will use a PJM Peak Loadshape that 
mirrors the ISO NE and ISO NY Loadshape.


Kenny; et al:

Please map in TEST and PROD

Index:  PJM Interconnection
Abb:  PJM InterC
Sort Code: 
Desc:  The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average 
of the hourly prices listed in the Index (in final, not estimate, form) for 
electricity delivered during Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the 
applicable Determination Period.  The Floating Price for each Determination 
Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by 
PJM Interconnection, LLC on its official web site currently located at

PICK NEWS - CALLS (continued)
*******************************************************
AOL  $144.50 -$1.25 (-2.00)  Hmmmmm-AOL flat for the week?
NOT!!  We deliberated whether to keep or drop AOL today,
but decided to keep it.  Read on.  AOL spiked up to close
at $165 earlier this week and has shed $20 in the last 3
trading days since.  Especially noted was the drop of $9
yesterday on 25 million shares (10 million more than
average-not a good sign).  Today though, AOL held up well
in the face of strong down-market forces on lower than
average volume.  It is, after all, the most stable of the
Internet stocks and is not going away.  While AOL feels
comfortable like a family pet, remember it's a trade that's
gone against us, and normally we would get out.  But with
the shaky Brazilian market perhaps drastically affecting
the rest of Latin America, we think the bad news and fear
is already in this stock.  We think of it more like a
rubber band stretched in reverse where the farther it's
stretched back, the harder it will snap forward.  It's
nerve-racking waiting for the bounce, but AOL is a split
candidate over $120 and should give us a great performance
once it snaps.  With a record breaking Christmas and 22,000
new users every day, AOL's earnings should be great.  Look
for the split announcement any day, or at the latest, with
earnings due Feb. 9 per Zack's. (There has been some
confusion on the actual date; Motley Fool board says as
early as Jan. 27.  We'll keep you posted.)  Still an
Internet-guts required.  Play with caution.

WCOM  $71.00 $2.94 (-4.00)  In this type of trading
environment where the ""big picture"" whollops the average
company press release, it pays to sit on the sidelines.  We
warned in Tuesday's letter that WCOM may need to
consolidate a bit before moving up, and urged discipline
before entering another trade.  We hope you waited.  WCOM
is still a great play, but we still need to wait for the
recovery before playing this pick.  They are now at their
30 day moving average and should bounce off it, market
permitting.  $70 is their support price.  Wait for the
bounce.  If it breaks below $70 and holds, we'll re-
evaluate and likely drop it.  WCOM is in high-bandwidth
content delivery tests with AOL, which should be successful
and more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC's
DSL services.  Remember too, they just won the FTS2000
contract (worth $5 billion)to provide the U.S. Government
with voice and data services for the next 8 years

T  $82.13 -$2.63(-$2.93)  AT&T is holding up quite well
given the market retrenchment this week.  The need to move
voice and information throughout the world will not
diminish, even in a down market.  AT&T could actually
become a low cost producer who benefits from cost-conscious
users exercising corporate belt-tightening.  It behaves
like a safe haven in a down market and a tech stock in an
up market.  Volume has been heavy over the last 2 days.  If
investors wanted to dump this stock, we'd have seen more
damage to the price.  Support is at $82 with better support
at $80.  AT&T's prospects are still great with the
integration of TCI helping to complete the ""last mile"" of
service availability to your home.  AT&T continues to melt
the copper in favor of fiber replacement at every turn.
Wait for the bounce and confirm market direction before
playing.

DELL  $77.63 -$1.69 (-$0.18)  Dell is holding up nicely
this week given the weak market performance.  Dell's volume
has also been weak.  We spoke with investor relations and
are now able to determine that volatility has greatly
diminished, and since their split in September, volume too.
Dell used to trade 50 million shares per day on average.
As the daily average is figured, the high numbers drop off
and new, lower numbers replace them.  This will naturally
reduce the average until it more closely resembles the
actual daily trades currently taking place.  It should not
be long until these 2 more closely resemble each other.  In
other words, the low volume is no longer cause for alarm
and supports our original assessment that huge daily price
swings are a thing of the past.  Dell's story is still the
same-big sales increases, more markets served, higher
margins.  When Dell's news season picks up (Feb.-March
according to investor relations), Dell will again be on
investors' radar screens.  Nothing's changed; they're just
a little quieter.  Still on our favorites list, consider
the slight retrenchment as a buying opportunity when the
market gets over its jitters.  Now's a good time to scale
into the trade, but confirm market direction first.

LXK $97.00 3.25 (-3.56) LXK fell with the rest of the market
on Thursday. We still like LXK with earnings coming up on
the 19th of January and the strong possibility of a stock
split. The Open Buying on the Internet(OBI) standard has taken
another leap forward with the adoption of Lexmark Interna-
tional's new OBI-compliant Internet purchasing system.  The
Kentucky-based printing solutions company has adopted a new
system that eliminates many of the manual processes Lexmark
previously used to purchase indirect materials.  Lexmark
has partnered with SupplyWorks, a Web-based purchasing
services company.  For the first time, buyers are not required
to purchase software to manage supplier connections.

LOW $51.38 -.31 (-3.31) LOW showed some nice strength today
with a loss of .6%. The DOW went down over 2%. LOW was
listed as one of the stocks picked in the dartboard contest.
Whether the professionals picking LOW is good or not is
a decision you'll have to make (just kidding). Look to last
Sunday for why LOW is a pick.  LOW's has earnings in mid-
February.  No new news.

ATI $78.81 +1.56 (-.19) ATI bucked the trend on Thursday, and
went up. Rumors continue to circulate about ATI being merged
with either BellAtlantic or Vodaphone. It's rumored that VOD
is offering in the range of $90 a share. The question now is
whether Bell is willing to raise its bid to match VOD. Thursday's
price increase was mainly due to this speculation. Bell did
just get notice from the SEC that its bid would classify as
a pooling of interests.  ATI is still $11 away from the rumored
bid by Vodaphone.

LU $105.93 +1.69 (-9.32) LU is a great company, with stock
split possibilities, and earnings coming up: so why are we
dropping it? We aren't. We have re-added LU to the pick list.
Last Tuesday we dropped LU because of the buyout situation
with Ascend. On Wednesday, the deal went through and it seems
LU has finished dropping. LU opened on Wednesday at $98.50,
yet closed at $104.50. LU is scheduled to report earnings on
January 21st. This date is in debate. We will try to get the
official date from LU directly. Though they are just short
of shares necessary to do a 2-1 stock split, they could
announce a split with earnings, contingent to the vote on

COF  Capital One Financial $127.18 1.18 (-.12 for this week)

Capital One Financial, a financial services holding company,
is the parent for Capital One Bank, one of the US's top 10
credit card companies. Using the information on consumers in
its massive databases, the company solicits Visa and
MasterCard customers by mail. The company's 3,000 variations
of annual percentage rates, credit limits, finance charges,
and fees range from platinum and gold cards for preferred
customers to secured and unsecured cards for customers with
limited credit histories. Other subsidiaries include a
federally chartered savings bank that offers credit cards,
consumer lending, and deposit services and a company that
provides internal support services.

COF is near its 52-week high and when this stock breaks out,
it tends to really go. We feel with earnings coming up on the
19th of January and the possibility of a stock split, this
could end up being a great play. COF is sitting right on its
20-dma and held up pretty well compared to the market. Watch
for upward movement and then jump on for the ride.

Preliminary numbers for credit card numbers are looking very
positive for the holiday season. An analyst at JP Morgan feels
that COF outperformed its peers. An analyst at Goldman Sachs
stated; ""The combination of strong fees driven by account
growth improvement in core credit is likely to produce very
strong earnings visibility at both Capital One and Providian.""
Earnings are expected to come in strong.

TLAB - Tellabs $80.69 -$0.44(+$6.38 this week)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major player.

TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78 on 11 million shares,
$8 higher than resistance previously set at $70.  We thought
it would quickly fall back; we were wrong.  TLAB drifted back
to $74, then spiked $5 to $79, on average volume of 3.5 million.
Over the previous 3 trading days, it gained in market weakness
while giving back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright
bearish market-a terrific sign of strength.  Technical
indicators are positive, so is the chart indicating a small
correction already taking place.  3.5 million shares traded
daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share in cash;
34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.   TLAB will be a
winner when the market turns.  We expect them to announce more
contracts in the coming weeks.  Recent news is capturing
investors' eyeballs, making for a good story.

Here goes.  Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised ther rating
to a ""buy"" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000, respectively.
They further stat, ""fundamentals for the telecom equipment
group has improved over the past few months which improves
visibility for Tellabs"" and ""Our checks with Tellabs will
report fourth quarter 1998 results slightly better than our
$0.58 earnings per share estimate, as well as having a positive
outlook for 1999"" (Reuters).  Also, rumors surfaced last week
that TLAB was a targeted buyout/merger candidate, but were
quickly squashed.  Not soon enough though to draw investor
attention to the price move.

DIS - Disney $36.06 -.06 (+3.50)

Striving to be the premier entertainment company, Disney has
revenues of $10,055.1 million. It is involved in movies,
television, theme parks and resorts, home video, travel,
books, music, theater, and creative design. Recently, It has
added an internet portal in a joint venture with Infoseek, in
which it has a 43% stake.

The past year has been tough for Disney, due to high
programming costs at its ABC division, and to weak demand for
its products in Asia.  Last week Merrill Lynch's Jessica
Reif Cohen lowered earnings estimates for the current fiscal
quarter from .27 to .23, and for the fiscal year ending Sept.
1999 from .91 to .86. She cited softness in consumer products
and broadcasting operations, and continued weakness in Asia.
However, three other analysts believe the stock is oversold
and that DIS is experiencing a recovery.  On Jan.12th, Goldman
Sachs raised their rating from Neutral to Outperform, and
Salomon Smith Barney raised theirs from Neutral to Buy. On Jan.
11th, ING Baring Furman Selz upgraded DIS to Buy from Hold.
On Jan. 12th, Disney and Infoseek launched their new
Internet portal site, Go Network (www.go.com).  Numbers show
that it will be one of the top 5 sites on the Internet.
Following the upgrades and the new portal launch, Disney
stock has performed well. Its chart looks good and it has
pushed through the major moving averages. Although it was
down today along with a lot of other stocks, it is still
up $3.50 for the week, showing strength.

Disney is still ironing out final details for production
and technical workers to return to work following a one
day strike on Nov. 3rd. Their contract had expired 3/97. The
company has named Thomas Schumaker a new president and put
him in charge of its animated movie and theater business. Also,
DIS may acquire Goldenbooks and is interested in Livent Inc.,
a theater co. When the market resumes its upward movement,
look for Disney to move back up.  Earnings are due out by
next Thursday (1/21) according to First Call.

Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE) - $47.69
Software

Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE) is a leading provider of publishing
and imaging software technologies, and the second largest
desktop software company in the world with annual revenues
approaching $1 billion. Adobe develops, markets and supports
computer software products that enable users to create,
display, print and communicate all forms of electronic
documents. Computer application products accounted for 78%
of fiscal 1997 revenues and licensing, 22%.

The Company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue
in the short term due to weak Japanese market conditions and
uncertain timing of OEM customer introductions of products
incorporating Adobe's latest technologies. The Company is
coming out of a recent restructuring and trying to focus its
resources on high growth revenue opportunities in digital
color, color inkjet, short-run on-demand digital printing,
and digital copiers... although licensing revenue is likely
to be flat in the short-term. Other risks include product
shipment delays, market acceptance of new products and
upgrades, declines in printer licensing business.

Stock likely to fail at key resistance point of $48.
Declining relative strength and aggressive earnings
projections may disappoint. Many analysts have a hold on the
stock. Slight distribution taking place among top
institutional shareholders. Likely to test 52 week lows.

COMBINATION PLAYS   Bang! Booommm! Craaash!...What was that???
******************************************************************
January 13, 1999 update

U.S. stocks crumbled at the opening on Wednesday morning on news
that Brazil's central bank president had resigned, sparking an
across-the-board flight to quality that rocked world stock markets.
The Dow was off 136, the Nasdaq down 113 and many issues had not
yet begun to trade. By mid-morning, stocks were on the rebound,
lifted by a recovery in Brazil and massive bargain hunting. By
noon, the panic was gone and many traders were selling partial
positions to lock-in gains. At the close, the Dow fell 125 points
to 9349.56 and recouped more than half its early losses. Even so,
the decline was viewed as a reminder of market vulnerability after
a series of record highs.

Our portfolio was very active. We will begin with the new plays:
LU was the focus of our attention and it dropped hard with the
rest of the high visibility techs. The stock traded as low as $96
but the first option prices available for the FEB105C/110C left
us with a debit of $1.75. Morgan Stanley raised its rating of LU
to a ""strong buy"" late in the morning and that helped the stock
move higher through the day. LUV was the next offering and it was
also significantly lower at the open. The first few trades on the
FEB22C/25C went through at about $1.25 debit. LEVL was far less
affected by the morning activity and the best we could do on the
FEB30C/35C was $3.25 debit. DIS was our personal play-of-the-day
and we managed to trade along with everyone else (fighting the
overwhelmed internet brokerages) with a $4.00 opening cost-basis
for the JAN00-40C/FEB40C LEAPS/Calendar spread.

In other portfolio plays; It was a great opportunity to double-up
(reducing the cost-basis) on some of the more favorable debit
positions. AOL and OXHP were our candidates and these stocks were
down at the open. The prices were: AOL, FEB155C/160C at $1.50 and
OXHP, FEB17C/20C at $1.00. We will reflect these separate trades
in the monthly summary. Of course, some of the calendar spreads
were in need of a correction and we used the opportunity to pare
losses from the recent run-up. Short positions were closed on:
ATI; JAN70C at $7.00, GM; JAN70C at $11.00, and PCS; JAN22C at
$2.38.

T was quite a mover! In the morning melee, we purchased the JAN80C
at $2.50 (with the stock price near $82) and subsequently closed
the FEB80C during the midday rebound for $8.50.

One other opportunity arose on the NXTL straddle. The MAY35P could
have been closed for $5.25, leaving the long (call) option; MAY30C
at cost of $2.87.

January 14, 1999 update

U.S. stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as the impeachment trial
against the President added pressure to an already shaken market.
Political instability is a catalyst for investor uncertainty and
that was evident as the DJIA fell 228 points to 9120, erasing all
the big gains for 1999. The Nasdaq Composite Index was also lower,
down 40 points at 2276. Stocks have been poised for a downturn
following the recent run-up in prices but some thought the strong
U.S. economy would protect the stock market from the impeachment
drama. However, the trial opened in an investment climate that had
already been shaken by the devaluation of Brazil's currency and
jittery investors flocked to the exits.

On Thursday, we used the morning bounce to fill some of our open
calendar positions: On ATI, we rolled up to the FEB75C at a bid
price of $7.25; GM was also moved to a diagonal spread with the
sale of the FEB75C for $8.50 and PCS was moved to the next higher
strike with a FEB25C at $2.87. These spreads are no longer neutral
and are now more aggressive with the new strike positions but we
expect all of these stocks to remain at-or-above current prices.

For Friday, we still have a number of suspect issues. CPQ and CD
are near the sold strikes and we may need to close those positions
before the day is over. FTU is fading as the merger speculation
dwindles and LU is still ""one to watch"" as the ASND deal unfolds
and the company earnings report aproaches. Good Luck!

CIEN - Ciena Corp.  $18.68     Merger Speculation

CIENA Corporation designs, manufactures and sells architecture,
dense wavelength division multiplexing systems for fiberoptic
communications networks. In September, Ciena and Tellabs cancelled
their merger agreement and shares in the rival equipment makers
fell sharply after Ciena's financial outlook soured, primarily
because an expected contract from AT&T fell through. In early
January, coverage was initiated by Prudential as the telecom
sector started to soar. Then the share price spiked on speculation
the telecommunications equipment-maker might find a merger partner
after the announced purchase of Ascend by Lucent. Some say there
is a market rumor that Cisco Systems is preparing a bid of $25-$28
per share for Ciena. Technically, the stock price is back in a
recent trading range around $17 (November-early December) and we
will use this previous support and the excellent OTM premiums to
create a favorable play.

AAPL - Apple Computers  $41.38     Put-Credit Spread

AAPL designs and manufactures and markets personal computers and
related personal computing and communicating solutions for sale
to business, education, home and government customers. A few weeks
ago, shares of Apple jumped after its iMac consumer PC was named
the top-selling personal computer at the retail level during the
month of November. Not only was the iMac the leading product, it
has been the number one selling PC since its introduction back in
August. The iMac has captured 5.9% of retail unit sales and it was
the only PC to break into the top five best-sellers group in four
months.

Now the bad news; one day after reporting excellent earnings, APPL
dropped $5.12 when an analyst voiced concerns about the pricing of
its iMac. This surprise downgrade comes even as the computer maker
reported revenues that easily surpassed Wall Street expectations.
The APPL chart looks negative from a short-term perspective but
there is still a long history of support around $37. Play this one
on downward momentum by opening the long position first. Then sell
the short position when the stock price firms, to create the credit
spread.

SUNW - Sun Microsystems  $94.50     Calendar Spread/LEAPS

SUNW supplies enterprise network computing products including
desktop systems, servers, storage subsystems, network switches,
software, microprocessors and a full range of services.

Personally, I just like this company from long-term perspective
and the ""Covered-calls on LEAPS"" strategy is a favorable way to
take advantage of the extreme near-term option premiums.

Please refer to the January 12, newsletter article concerning
SUNW for more information:

http://www.optioninvestor.com/playoftheday/index.asp

PLAY (conservative/long-term):

BUY  CALL JAN00-100 LSU-AT OI=1580 A=$19.63
SELL CALL FEB-100   SUQ-BT OI=3181 B=$5.87
NET DEBIT TARGET=$13.50 ROI TARGET=100%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the LEAP by the amount of credit from the sale of the
nearer term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your LEAP is going up in value also and on the last day
of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to intrinsic
value so you will be ahead in the play even after you buy it back.

Japan, Asia, Russia, Brazil. Who is next??


Another day, another excuse for profit taking. The market sold off
again with the Brazilian flu along with a dose of impeachment blues.

The market started down early and showed little interest in turning
around. The rumors from Brazil were all negative. Coupled with the
resignation of yet another government official the rumor that the
Central Bank was set to let the Real float knocked the Brazil market
for another -10% loss. Floating the Real, the Brazilian currency,
would be a drastic devaluation since the currency would then be free
to find its own level.

Floating could start the domino theory fall of all the surrounding
Latin American countries that depend on Brazil for trade. Chile and
Argentina would be the first to go. If South America were to devalue
as a group then the countries who export to South America would be
put on a diet. The U.S., depending on who you talk to and what area
they reference, exports to South America account for between 17-25%
of our total. Companies like Colgate derive 40% of their revenue from
Latin countries.

If the feared event happened then the results would be drastic. The
companies who derive a large percentage of their business from there
would suffer huge earnings shortfalls. Layoffs could occur, plant
closings, etc. That would be the extreme but it is possible. Possible
but not probable. There are many things that can and will happen
before we get to that point. Rest assured that every Fed head in the
world is concerned about the Brazil problem. The IMF will be very
interested in preventing this scenario. Cardosa is very interested.
Power and pressure are being brought to bear. The Brazil Central
Bank issued a strongly worded press release stating they would use
every means at their disposal to prevent floating the Real. They
said they would use their $50 bln in reserves to protect the Real.
This was only minimally comforting to the market this afternoon.
Memories of many other countries last minute claims to the same
intent, and then immediate devaluation, are fresh. Russia was the
latest. While analysts feel there could be serious impacts from a
possible worst case, they also feel that the market has now discounted
the most likely scenario which is months of protracted, painful,
negotiations ending in an agreement of some sort to yet another bail
out. No harm, no foul. Just uncertainty.

Meanwhile the market has now ""corrected"" five percent off its record
high of just last week. My how short our memory can be. 9643, only
five trading days ago. Champagne was already being ordered for the
Dow 10,000 celebration. Should we cancel the order? Not hardly.

As I have said many times the market cycles. Remember last week when
I kept warning you about an impending bout of profit taking. Its'
here and I don't think it is over. Fear of darkness is only beaten
out by one other thing. Fear of a long holiday weekend. Yep, closed
Monday for MLK day. I have already had one of my brokers call me to
ask if I want some currency positions left open over the long weekend.
Seems the currency market closes at 1:PM on Friday. Now if you were
a country that needed to manipulate some currency to benefit your
country, a U.S. holiday would be the perfect time. Don't laugh.
Japan does it all the time. The same thing on a smaller scale can
happen to stock profits held over a holiday. Events happen, mass
exodus at Tuesday's open. Remember Wednesday morning?

You may think I have put on a fur coat. Far be it from the truth.
I am long several hundred contracts of tech stocks and I am looking
for a recovery soon. Again, being long does not make me right, just
very interested in the outcome.

I have not elaborated on the market impact from the impeachment trial
and won't because I don't think there is any impact. As I have said
before, the chances of a guilty vote are about zero and the market
knows this.

If you watched any market TV today then you know the Internet stocks
are finally starting to weave. They are getting beat from all sides.
Brokers are cutting the ratings on the high flyers left and right.
Funny how the smell of blood brings out the crowd. Nobody would cut
them last week when they were adding $20 a day. It is dogpile time
now. To add insult to injury the online brokers are now starting
to prevent customers from actually buying the stocks. I am not
kidding. Some have taken them off the margin list. If you want to
buy you have to pay cash, 100%. Others will not let you buy them
online. You have to call a broker and wait on the line while they
verify your eligibility to purchase high risk investments! Others
refuse to execute the trades at all. You might hurt yourself. Does
it strike you strange that Internet brokers will not let you buy
Internet stocks??? What ever happened to the concept of ""it is
your money not theirs."" In the face of this conspiracy to protect
you from yourself the Internets are losing ground quickly. Except
AOL. AOL has somehow avoided the label of ""overpriced"" and actually
garnered several honorable mentions from analysts downgrading other
Internet stocks. Guess where Internet money will go now?

For you technicians out there the pendulum has swung from
overbought to oversold in a very short period of time. The Dow
is now down -522 points in the last five days. Both the Dow and
the Nasdaq have corrected about 5%. Just as the sharp run up last
week was begging for a dip, this sharp dip is now begging for a
rally. The big drop today was on the lightest Dow volume in over
a week. Not as much conviction today just a lack of buyers. This
was also the third triple digit loss in a row. As I mentioned
earlier I think the odds for a down day Friday are still pretty
good. The wild card again is the options expiration which normally
provides an upward bias. I can't build a case for a strong move
upward because of Brazil and the holiday but I can see a strong
Tuesday coming as long as Brazil does not meltdown over the weekend.
Earnings will be on us in earnest next week with MSFT, LU, SUNW
announcing along with dozens of others. I think the focus on
Brazil will have dimmed and the anticipation of upside surprises
will take center stage.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************************

Stay Focused on the Pinnacle Index

After selling off precipitously over the past couple of days, it
is very important to keep in eye on the Pinnacle Index and other
put/call ratios for clues as to whether the sell-off is a major
reversal or profit taking.

Based upon the early returns, it appears that most option
speculators are viewing the sell-off as profit taking and this
could be prove BEARISH over the near-term.  Despite the negative
economic news from Brazil, the Pinnacle Index actually climbed
and other put/call ratios indicate increased call buying.

Add this to the latest Bullish figures from Investors
Intelligence (60% Bullish 1/14) you get the impression that
investors are ignoring economic and corporate earnings pressures.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing bearish
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions
regarding market sentiment can be directed at:

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.


CALLS:
******

CMGI $105.00 -8.44 (+40.75) After being derailed by the
Brazilian devaluation bomb midweek, the market when into
a tailspin and the Internets were no exception.  After
Monday's earth shaking surge of $71.75, CMGI has dwindled
away 31 points in the last 3 days ($62 pre-split).  With
a host of downgrades raining down on several of the big
hitters in the Internet sector, we figure it is time to
dodge the bullet before some valuation happy analyst sets
their sights on CMGI.  We are cutting CMGI loose and
hopefully it's consolidation will be quick.

AMZN $138.00 -10.00 (-22.25)  Brazilian devaluation.
Analysts' downgrades due to valuation.  Bearish short-term
remarks.  Impeachment proceedings.  Option expirations.  What
else can we add to the mixture in this pot of volatility??
Amazon had been doing just fine when it popped up over +$75.00
last week.  Not this week!  On Thursday in a sign of weakness,
Amazon finished only two and a half points off its low for the
day to close at $138.00.  Even earnings reports from companies
such as Yahoo that beat estimates weren't enough to carry
sympathy plays like Amazon into positive territory.  We are
dropping Amazon as a pick.  This is not to say that Amazon
won't turn around- and soon.  But in light of current
circumstances, we feel there are safer plays to be in.

ASND $82.13 +1.81 (+10.69) We finally got the price that LU is
paying for ASND, and it is .825 shares of LU for each share of
ASND.  The reason we are dropping ASND is because it has
effectively turned into a LU play since the purchase price has
been announced.  There is a little more room for ASND to move
given the share ratio, but typically the acquiree does not
close the gap completely because of the uncertainty of the deal
being closed.  There is no hint of competing bids, but ASND
would be a current play again if a bidding war started for it.

SLR $83.56 -1.50(-6.07) We are dropping SLR with the idea
we might pick it back up closer to the earnings report and
stock split date. As predicted, SLR announced a 2-1 stock
split this week. They announced after close on Wednesday.
Unfortunately, with the market volatility, SLR went down on
the day. We did see an opening that sent SLR up a few dollars,
but this faded into a loss by days end. SLR could definitely
see a split and earnings run, but we feel it's better to wait
for confirmation.

JPM  $102.00 4.56 (-12.44) The comeback in financial stocks
was derailed this week.  Hammered by the problems in Brazil,
JPMorgan lost another $4.56 today.  When we initiated this
play, JPM had momentum and its chart looked good.  However,
it's exposure to Brazil is too great, and given the seriousness
of the political and economic troubles in that country, we
have to drop JPM as a play.

GDT  $103.63  3.38 (-3.37) Guidant has lost ground since
setting an intra-day high of $119.75 on Monday. With just
13 days to go before it splits, GDT should be cruising into
a split run. It tried on Monday, but weakness in the overall
market has held it back. If the market turns positive again,
so will Guidant.  However, with the questionable market
footing we are going to cut Guidant loose until things firm up



PUTS:

NONE



PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************

FTL  $17.06 -.06 (-1.44)  FTL was added as a possible take
over play this week.  Something is going on but what?  We
are constantly pouring over news and rumor mongers only to
discover on Wednesday morning wires, trading was halted for
a block of shares (73,100) to trade at $16.06 down $-1.56.
Then we read about 100,000 shares being crossed by
Goldman Sachs.  Plus another 100,000 was traded at $17 today
by Salomon Smith Barney.  Unlike the techs' FTL did not suffer in
todays' trading, opening $17.69, taking a little off the table
to $16.69 then closing at $17.06.  Not providing a great
warm a fuzzy feeling, but enough of a feeling to keep this
as a play.  Remember, rumors are predicting a buyout at $23
or more.

MYG $63.25 -0.69 (-0.75)  Between Tuesday and Wednesday, MYG
seemed to be holding its own and only lost thirty-one cents
as the market dropped a combined -270.33 points.  But
Brazilian woes continued and the market plummeted another
-228.63 on Thursday.  Maytag fought and fought but finally,
the market scored a point with a knock-down.  Maytag was
stunned and conceded -$0.69.  MYG is normally a strong play
and is still one of our split candidates.  But, the market
is extremely volatile and we suggest waiting for things to
turn around before starting any new plays.

SUNW $94.50 -2.31 (+3.62)  Sun is one of the brightest stocks
on Wall Street even though the Brazilian storm continues to
darken the market.  Sun is up +$3.62 on the week from positive
press releases and rumors of a possible take-over by IBM.  On
Wednesday, CNBC presented the rumor which ended up being
dismissed as smoke but option trade volume increased none the
less.  We will keep you posted of any changes in the scenario.
In other news, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its 12-month
price target for SUNW to $132, up from the previous price of
$104.  Not only does Sun have the only end to end computing
platform used in telecommunications services, it is also
working on incorporating its Java technology into the digital
TV industry.  Even though SUNW got ruffled by the market and
dropped -$2.31 on Thursday, SUNW is still a strong play.
Earnings for the company are scheduled for Jan 21st (not the
15th as we had previously reported), a prime time to announce
a possible split.  Look at the additional dip as a buying
opportunity but wait for some signs of a turn around before
entering.  Trying to catch a falling knife tends to damage
fingers and trading capital.

EMC $93.88 +1.56 (+.31) EMC is a pretty amazing momentum stock.
The NASDAQ is down 1.7% today, and EMC goes up.  On Wednesday,
EMC's gap down went as low as $84, but it was such a fast
market it probably was not a price you could have gotten
easily.  During the first 15 minutes of trading on Wednesday
1 million shares were traded.  This was almost half of
Wednesday's volume, and one-third of EMC's average daily
volume. There hasn't been any news on EMC, but then again, it
doesn't look like we need any.  FYI  In our Sunday write-up we
had EMC's earnings release date as 1/28, but we have since
learned that the release date is either 1/25 or 1/26.

JBL $71.31 -.69 (-3.56) JBL held up pretty well today
considering the action in the market.  I am sure that the
coverage initiated on JBL by Everen Securities helped.  The
press release did note, however, that in the near-term they
believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long term
it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
probably helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together, but JBL appears to be the
upper crust of a volatile group.

UTX $108.56 2.31 (-6.13) UTX is very Dow sensitive.  Let's
illustrate it.  The Dow is down 2.3% today and UTX was down
2.1%.  It has been that way all week.  The only thing at this
point that would probably change UTX's price movement is a pre-
earnings announcement one way or the other.  UTX announces
earnings next week.  On the news side, we are amazed at the
number of varied businesses of UTX.  For example, today UTX
announced that its Hamilton Standard unit signed a letter of
intent to joint venture with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to focus
on the maintenance of pneumatic aircraft components.  In the
press release it indicated that it's Hamilton unit also makes
space suits for the NASA shuttle program.  Only play UTX if the
Dow is moving up.

MSFT  $141.75 -$2.06 (-8.13)  Like we said, don't try to
catch a falling knife.  Though, we shrugged off an ugly
beginning to finish over 1 point positive yesterday, today
we gave it back, and then some.  We're still positive on
MSFT given their trial has begun to produce positive news,
like their appeal of the Judge's decision to force MSFT to
use Sun's version of Java in its Windows operating system,
and a new stream of MSFT-friendly witnesses on the stand.
Furthermore, Prudential Securities said analyst Doug Crooke
initiated coverage of Microsoft Corp. with a rating of
accumulate and a price target of $175 a share.  MSFT is
still a split candidate at over $140 and will announce
earnings January 19 after the close.  We realize that
trading options is inherently risky and caution to wait for
a reversal in the stock and the overall market before
starting another play.  If it falls another day, let it
fall.  The point is to catch a good entry on the way up,
not on the way down.

One more thing.  Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts?  Those 
have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered.  Therefore, 
please advise what you received from Enron in that regard.

I was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were 
submitting as confidential information, specifically including the responses 
to the Public Staff's data requests.  I don't recall the specifics at this 
point.

Thanks again,

Kay

The Application itself is public.  The testimony is public.  Without going
back through the material we have supplied (which I would be happy to do, if
you like), the primary material that was confidential was the cost data and
supporting work papers.  Also, the engineering plan we filed recently in
response to a data request was confidential.

Let me know if you would like me to walk back through it more specifically.

Hi Allyson,

Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public
information.  Is the petition itself public?  What else would be public?

I know this is a variation to the ""what is confidential"" question. Once
again, your assistance is appreciated.

Hi Katie,   Looks like you got the address right.  I too enjoyed talking with 
you last night.  I know you were disappointed to be distracted from your 
research project for a while.  

Its been a busy week so far.  The end of the yearly quarter always is.  Last 
minute deals have to be closed to book the income.  At this time of year the 
commercial dealmakers get that wild eyed looked which says ""I have got to get 
this project done or I am out of here"".  March 31 can't arrive soon enough.  

Got any big plans for the weekend?  Hanging out at the Dixie Chicken or is 
that only where rookies hang out?  

Take care and I'll talk to you later.

Gerald

Since TXU terminated (effective 2/26/02) should we still send the demand letter?  I'm thinking not.  The goal of moving the contract to terminated status has been accomplished and I doubt they will pay anything now considering we have agreed to begin settlement discussion.  Furthermore, I don't want to irritate the situation with them.

What do you think?

Attached for your information is a copy of the Petition for Modification of=
 =20
D.01-05-064 which ABAG POWER filed on July 13.? On behalf of ABAG, I would =
=20
like to solicit your support of this petition.? The decision in question is=
 =20
the Commission's May 15 decision where it approved the rate design for the =
=20
three-cent rate increase.?=20
?
You may recall that the decision approved a 12-month surcharge for all =20
bundled service customers to make up for the revenue which PG&E and SCE did=
 =20
not recover during the interim period between the March 27 issuance of =20
D.01-03-082 and the subsequent issuance of the May 15 decision.? You also =
=20
know that the May decision provided specifically that DA customers were NOT=
=20
to  be subject to the rate increase.=20
?
The ABAG petition for modification seeks to have the Commission clarify  th=
at=20
DA customers who received DA service during the interim period between the =
=20
two decisions should not be subject to the one-year sucharge, even if they=
=20
were  subsequently returned to bundled service.? The arguments supporting=
=20
this  position are as follows:

Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the=20
procurement-related rate  increase because they do not receive procurement=
=20
service.? They should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month=20
procurement surcharge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled=20
service.? =20
The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit=
=20
have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under significa=
nt=20
financial stress.? The Member public agencies have  suffered extreme=20
financial hardship.?  The application of the 12-month procurement surcharge=
=20
has added to that  burden unnecessarily.
In a separate  proceeding (draft Resolution E-3726),? the Commission has=20
expressed  its intent to =01&guard against inequities=018 for direct access=
=20
customers of  SDG&E.? ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford=20
similar protection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not=20
receive bundled procurement service during the  interval between the March=
=20
and May Decisions.?=20
Moreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the=20
procurement surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be=
=20
discriminatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the=20
anti-discrimination provisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(=
a)=20
and 453(c).

ABAG POWER  would very much appreciate the support of ESPs and other market=
=20
participants at  the Commission.? Under Rule 47(f) of the Commission's Rule=
s=20
of Practice and  Procedure, ""Responses to petitions for modification must b=
e=20
filed and served  within 30 days of the date that the petition was served,=

Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

After meeting with AEP this morning, some issues are revolved and new one 
added.

Resolved:

 Confirmations will be done out of AEP's systems for long term deals, 
intramonth transactions
 will be confirmed using DECAF 2.  DECAF 1 will not be used.

 Global Facilities will not need to copied to a new pipeline code.

 The HPL DUN's number will remain the same.

 Deal entry will be manual for AEP risk system and getting old deals back 
into Sitara.
 The need to build a cross-reference table is the main driver.

New items

 A hands-on  training program is unlikely due to time  and space constrains.
 AEP/Enron evaluating options.

 New Risk Portfolios need to created in Sitara.  List provided to AEP.
 Enron giving explanations of portfolios for usefulness to AEP.

 Manual entries to G/L and reports needed to book all items.


All items on the Energy ops issues list were discussed.  AEP to fill in point 
person
for there side. 

Agreement reached to use this format and add items as needed.

I will issue a revised transitions issues list tomorrow afternoon, after my 
energy ops
meeting.

IssueAlert for  February 28, 2001=20

Constellation to Build Major Plant in California,=20
First in Over a Decade

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Constellation Energy Group (NYSE: CEG) announced that Kiewit Industrial=20
Company of Omaha, Neb., will begin construction in early April of the 750-M=
W=20
High Desert power plant near Victorville, Calif. The project, which has bee=
n=20
in development since the mid-1990s by High Desert Power Project, LLC=01*a=
=20
subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group of Baltimore, Md.=01*will be the f=
irst=20
new major power plant to serve the Southern California area in more than a=
=20
decade.=20

Analysis: The fact that California suffers from a significant supply / dema=
nd=20
imbalance, and that no new major power plant has been built in the state in=
=20
over a decade, has been well documented in the energy industry press.=20
Consequently, the fact that Constellation Energy Group is now close to=20
breaking ground on its new plant (having completed the laborious plant siti=
ng=20
requirements in California) is a major=01*and somewhat surprising=01*coup f=
or the=20
company, considering that its generation expertise has primarily been in th=
e=20
Northeast nuclear industry. Constellation Energy Group has said that it wil=
l=20
market power from the plant within California, which should prove to be a w=
in=20
/ win scenario for both the company and the state.=20

The High Desert power plant will be built on a 25-acre site at the Southern=
=20
California Logistics Airport, formerly known as the George Air Force Base.=
=20
Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for June 2003. The plant's=
=20
electric generating technology is based on clean-burning, natural gas-fired=
=20
combustion turbines operating in a combined-cycle mode. Part of the current=
=20
supply problem in California is the fact that hydroelectric resources, the=
=20
state's primary energy source, have been in short supply due to=20
lower-than-average rainfall over the last year. Moving away from a dependen=
cy=20
on hydroelectric supply may be a smart move for the state. In addition, the=
=20
High Desert plant is consistent with a national trend that supports natural=
=20
gas as the fuel of choice for new power plant development projects. As a=20
point of interest, according to data from the Energy Information=20
Administration, California's fuel mix is primarily based in a mixture of=20
natural gas (45.59 percent), hydro (21.95 percent), nuclear (18.07 percent)=
,=20
coal (1.36 percent), oil (1.04 percent), and other, presumably renewable,=
=20
sources (11.98 percent).=20

It is rather surprising that Constellation would be the first company to=20
build a major power plant in California in over a decade, considering the=
=20
company's consistent geographic and fuel-mix focus. Constellation Energy=20
Group is a holding company that includes a group of competitive energy=20
businesses focused mostly on wholesale power marketing, merchant generation=
=20
and portfolio management in North America. Constellation Energy Group is th=
e=20
parent company of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), a regulated=
=20
gas and electric delivery company serving Central Maryland. Up until this=
=20
point, Constellation's generation assets have been primarily based in a=20
mixture of coal and nuclear, and for the most part located in the=20
Northeastern United States. According to information directly from the=20
company itself, Constellation's own fuel mix is predominantly coal (54=20
percent), followed by nuclear (40 percent). Oil, gas and hydro only represe=
nt=20
a small percentage (6 percent) of Constellation's fuel mix.=20

Although coal is the primary fuel in Constellation's portfolio, over the la=
st=20
year the company has become more focused on nuclear. For instance, last=20
December Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation=
=20
Energy Group, announced its intent to purchase 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82=
=20
percent of Unit 2 of the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant. Once the deal=
=20
is closed in mid-2001, Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine=
=20
Mile Point's 1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The nuclear plant=20
purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset=
,=20
an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland. When I wrote about=
=20
this acquisition last December, I noted that, while Constellation will most=
=20
likely retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company appeared to be=
=20
moving closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio.=20

In addition, in early 2000 Constellation began a restructuring of its=20
corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments: one=
=20
focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclear) a=
nd=20
the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant energy=
=20
business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the=
=20
third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding this growt=
h.=20
The goal for the merchant energy business, according to Constellation Energ=
y=20
Group CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000 =
MW=20
of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellation=
=20
acknowledged earlier that it would be taking advantage of ""bargain prices f=
or=20
nuclear plants,"" which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing=
=20
on transmission operations and thus choosing, or being mandated, to divest=
=20
their generation plants.  Constellation in the past has justified its move =
in=20
this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is=
=20
cheaper than coal and gas generators and that ""the economics [of nuclear] a=
re=20
quite robust, once they are calculated out."" =20

However, considering that there is only a limited number of nuclear plants =
in=20
the United States that will become available for purchase, Constellation=20
Energy Group may have recognized the need to become even more diversified.=
=20
The California market, despite its stringent plant siting requirements,=20
arguably offered an appropriate market for Constellation to become more=20
diversified. Given the state's environmental lobbying presence, it is=20
doubtful that a nuclear plant could have been approved in California.=20
Although natural gas is not a primary fuel source for Constellation as a=20
company, it is the preferred source for new power plants. Therefore, the Hi=
gh=20
Desert plant, given that it will be fired by natural gas, presumably stood =
a=20
greater chance of navigating through California's plant siting requirements=
=20
(than a coal or nuclear plant could have). In fact, in the announcement of=
=20
the plant, Constellation noted that, having received all federal, state and=
=20
local approvals, the High Desert plant ""will be a good neighbor in the=20
community with no significant environmental impacts.""=20

The announcement of Constellation's new plant could not come at a better ti=
me=20
for California, of course. Although the plant won't be operational until Ju=
ne=20
2003, the state can use the good publicity now. A new report from the=20
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) says that it is already too lat=
e=20
for the state to head off a serious summer shortage that could lead to at=
=20
least 20 hours of rolling blackouts. ""It's too late for this summer,""=20
declared Lawrence J. Makovich, of CERA, referring to the state's desperate=
=20
efforts to ramp up power supplies for the short term. ""The source of=20
California's far-reaching power crisis is a shortage. At least 5,000=20
megawatts of new generating facilities are required to restore balance to t=
he=20
state's grid."" Instead, according to the report, demand will exceed supply =
by=20
3,000 MW, which will cause the state to be under an energy alert of some so=
rt=20
for at least 200 hours.=20

CERA's report came out on the heels of Calif. Gov. Gray Davis' pledge to ha=
ve=20
5,000 MW of new generating capacity available in California by July, more=
=20
than double the amount expected just a few months ago. Davis said the new=
=20
plants would provide enough electricity to ward off blackouts this summer,=
=20
which CERA obviously disputes. Davis announced a series of orders intended =
to=20
bring online 5,000 MW by July 2001, with an additional 5,000 MW by July=20
2002. =20

In any event, as California continues to struggle from a severe supply /=20
demand imbalance, the announcement of Constellation's new plant appears to =
be=20
good news for all the parties involved. Gov. Davis has pledged to support a=
n=20
expedited approval process for additional plants, so it will be interesting=
=20
to see which company is given approval to proceed with the next power plant=
=20
in the state. It will also be interesting to see, based on Constellation's=
=20
plant and others that may be built, whether or not the economics of buildin=
g=20
such plants in California will prove beneficial. Other power suppliers may=
=20
opt to merely enter into long-term sales agreements with the state, rather=
=20
than invest the resources that building a power plant would require.=20

Dear Rob:

   I am going to be in Houston on business next week from Wednesday on.  I
wondered if there might be a convenient time to stop in to say hello and if
possible take you up on your offer of an introduction to Jim Derrick.  I
have a series of meetings downtown over the three days.  Any one could
easily be moved.  

   Thanks for your help.

   Kindest regards.

Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-
 
The total nomination for month of October 2001 is 17,029MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the following:
 
1. 4,029MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa@ $7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day undertwo separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
8  2,500MMBtu/day under a Q3 contract @ $8.925/MMBtu that we had forgotten about earlier...
 
 
Losses on the PG & E line are unchanged from September 2001 at 2.57%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.
 
We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect, temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit (Broadway 3) is on line and a second one, Broadway 2, is off and on during the month.  During the last few days of September and the first week of October, we will have our third steam unit Broadway 1 online for testing.  Usage should be up during this time.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve

Diann:  I don't see how we can go back to our residential customers and seek 
to recover these Rate Reduction Bond Credits since the utility has already 
paid them to the residentials and our contracts never said we were entitled 
to any such credits.  Do you all agree?  Marianne

Subject: Re: SDG&E Credits  

All,  this is currently an issue not only with the Annual Merger Savings 
Credit, but also the SDGE Rate Reduction Bond Credits.  SDGE recently 
refunded these credits to our customers by check.  We are currently in the 
process of collecting these credits from the commercial accounts.   But, do 
we recover these credits (amounting to $765,000) from the residential 
customers?

 Below is a description of the reason for this credit.


> This credit has been made possible due to a unique set of circumstances
> involving electric industry restructuring, which has proceeded in
> accordance with California State law (AB 1890).  AB 1890 required SDG&E
to
> lower electric rates by 10% for residential and small commercial
> customers, then froze rate levels for up to 4? years.  AB 1890 also
> allowed SDG&E to issue rate reduction bonds to finance the rate
reduction.
> In 1997, SDG&E issued rate reduction bonds in an amount adequate to
> provide a 10% rate reduction for 4? years.
>
> However, SDG&E was able to recover many costs related to the transition
to
> a competitive market 2
 years early -- by last July -- through the sale
of
> its two San Diego power plants at higher than expected prices and through
> numerous other actions.  That combination of factors and the benefits of
> the rate reduction bonds mean SDG&E is able to distribute about $390
> million to its customers.
>
> The bonds cannot be paid off early, so the current ""trust transfer
amount""
> line item on the SDG&E bill, which pays for the bonds, will continue for
> the bond life.
>
> An important point to clarify is that the money being distributed does
not
> represent over-collections from prior years.  Customers have benefited
> from many of the changes brought about by electric industry
restructuring.
> These include the 10% electric rate reduction, the electric rate freeze
> and the monthly trust transfer amount credit.  The trust transfer amount
> is the charge that pays for the rate reduction bonds, has funded the
> benefits customers have already received and is funding this ""lump sum
> trust transfer amount credit"".

Dennis:  Just wanted to bring this item to your attention.  We've researched 
the terms of our residential agreements and have noted that they are silent 
as to the issue of credits/refunds.  I've asked Jeff and Mike Day, our 
regulatory counsel in CA, for their input on whether we should refund these 
credits back to our residential customers.

 Notwithstanding  the fact that the language of the original decision 
allowing the credits does not address direct access customers, Jeff and Mike 
recommend, given the current climate in California, that we take action to 
refund these credits to our residential customers. 

 Just want to make sure you're ""on board"" with this before we direct CSC to 
refund the credit back to our residential accounts...Marianne

Subject: SDG&E Credits

Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:

Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
Credits.

Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
(per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?

Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?

Who could handle this issue for Diane?

Thanks, KC

We need to change the demand fee on deal 384258 for Tenaska IV for 4/01.  The Williams invoice was not as much as the spreadsheet showed, so our expenses decreased.  Please change the amount from $2,979,909.91 to $2,862,531.95.  I have attached the revised spreadsheet.

Recommendations:

As the General Manager of the PERC/Enron Joint Power Development Program, 
Enron hereby submits its recommendations to the Management Committee for 
their consideration regarding the pending Torrence south parcel land 
acquisition decision.

After reviewing the relevant commercial, legal and environmental issues with 
the respective Project Managers and development personnel, Enron recommends 
that the following courses of action be undertaken:

1.  PERC should notify Peoples Gas, Light & Coke (PGL) on 6/16/00 that PERC 
does not intend to assume the role of Buyer as provided for in the terms of 
the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 
4/11/2000. 

2.  Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land 
purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000 and PGL 
proceeds to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing, PERC and Enron should continue 
their due diligence and development activities on the Torrence south parcel.  
Upon establishment of a proposed budget and schedule, these activities should 
be focused on achieving the goals of minimizing out-of-pocket development 
expenses and implementing prudent risk mitigation strategies on behalf of 
PERC and Enron.

3.  Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land 
purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000 and PGL 
plans to proceed to the scheduled 6/26/00 closing, PERC and PGL should 
immediately begin preparation of the documents necessary to achieve the ICC 
approval of any future transfer (sale,lease, or alternative structure) of the 
Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.


Other Issues/Risks:

1.  This recommendation is based upon the belief that although the Torrence 
south parcel does hold potential value to PERC and Enron as a project 
development site, the overall viability and risk/reward profile of the 
commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized.  

The potential sources of value associated with this site are listed below:

 a. The site/project currently hold a priority position in the ComEd 
interconnection queue.
 b. The site (in combination with the Calumet project) captures the majority 
of available interconnection capability (500-600 MW) in the Calumet region of 
the ComEd system.  This would force competing IPP projects (i.e. Wizvest) to 
bear the financial burden of ComEd system upgrade costs.
 c. The site (in combination with the Calumet project) represents an integral 
component of developing a commercial solution to the Mission Energy/ComEd 500 
MW ""in-city"" regulatory obligation to the city of the Chicago.
 d. The site represents one of the unique in-city sites capable of supporting 
a power project from a zoning, fuel supply, and transmission perspective.

The factors contributing to the recommendation for PERC and Enron not to 
proceed to closing on 6/26/00 are listed below:

 a. The existence of known environmental contamination and the liabilities 
associated with entering the chain of title on the Torrence south parcel.
 b. The indemnification language contained within the land purchase Agreement 
executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000.
 c. The incomplete status of the overall commercial development opportunity 
associated with the Torrence south parcel.
 d. PERC and Enron's desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize 
development costs while further developing the commercial development 
opportunity and associated value proposition prior to executing an 
ICC-approved land transfer from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.


2.  It is PERC and Enron's understanding that PGL plans to proceed to the 
closing on 6/26/00 and assume the role of Buyer under the terms of the land 
purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on 4/11/2000.  

3.  The south parcel represents a potential power plant development project 
site upon which PERC and Enron will continue to conduct due diligence and 
development activities.  The site is currently being evaluated as a candidate 
for a 6 x LM 6000 facility with either an '01 or '02 in-service date.

4.  PERC and Enron have decided that it would not be prudent for either of 
their respective organizations to assume any form of environmental liability 
associated with the Torrence south parcel. PERC and Enron shall work to 
develop risk mitigation strategies including land options, environmental 
indemnifications, and other structures which protect their respective assets 
and the overall economic viability of a development project on the Torrence 
south parcel.

5.  A potential risk associated with the above recommendations is that the 
time required to complete the ICC approval process necessary to transfer the 
Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC.  PERC development 
personnel have estimated that the ICC approval process could require up to 6 
months (The transfer of the Calumet parcel was ""fast-tracked"" and took 3 
months to achieve ICC approval).  This risk could impact the viability of an 
'01 in-service date for a Torrence Power LLC development project.  PERC and 
Enron will work to minimize the impact of this risk.

6.  PERC and Enron shall work to develop a binding agreement which specifies 
an approval and cost-sharing mechanism for future development decisions on 
the Torrence south parcel.  Such an agreement shall also specify a formula 
for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketing/selldown strategy 
currently under development by PERC and Enron for all of the Chicago 
development projects.


Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss the 
above recommendations and information.

total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to 
talk with Lee at GE.

I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They 
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of 
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.

Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is 
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not 
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the 
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay 
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is 
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.

The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable 
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase 
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar 
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing 
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?

Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit 
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for 
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are 
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at 
LV Co-Gen?

Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will 
let you know when I hear back from him.

Fred

Fred,

Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGen 
project, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakout 
contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does 
GE know this is coming?

What are you projecting for a closing date?

 We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, 
price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the 
LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.  
Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?

If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  We 
have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact, 
I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the 
other deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm 
sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I 
can get started on the process if you are ready.

If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's.  We may want 
two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.  Kathleen, please talk to 
me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

Kay

Steve:

I talked with Ben this afternoon and understand that we are ready to proceed 
with Panda Energy in a transaction involving the sale of member interests in 
special purpose entities associated with the four(4) LV units.  I have left a 
message with Panda letting them know that we are prepared to proceed and will 
begin preparing a set of draft definitive agreements for their review.  I 
have asked Panda to confirm that they are ready to receive these documents 
and proceed.  I understand that you are in Houston.  Please call/see me 
tomorrow morning so that we can discuss this transaction.

Kay:  We need to prepare a draft set of definitive agreements for this 
transaction.  Can Carolyn complete this while you are in New York?  Also, 
what is the status of the LM Breakout contract for the 4 LV units.  Let me 
know.

Kathleen:  We need to confirm tomorrow morning that we have received executed 
CA's from Panda.  I have the CA execution originals for the four Panda 
entities at my desk for Ben's signature.  These need to be received prior to 
sending Panda the definitive agreements.  We will fax signature pages to Ben 
tomorrow.

Chris:  See me tomorrow morning to discuss the technical spec's that were 
sent to Panda

I will be at my desk by 8 am tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Fred

Hi Andy

I will speak on any panel, but my preference would be the  1st panel and I 
would speak on the CA experience and how EEI helps.  Also, I'd be happy to do 
products on day 2.  Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you soon.

PS Thanks so much for the plant - it is resting comfortably in my office and 
reminds me of all the times at EEI meetings and the wonderful friends I have 
met during this process."

ENTERGY, FPL GROUP SAY =01+ISSUES HAVE ARISEN=01,
IN PENDING MERGER, WILL NEED MORE TALKS
Entergy and FPL Group said Monday that they would hold talks soon to
address a address =01&certain issues=018 that have arisen in connection wit=
h their
pending merger, which had been agreed to last July. In a joint statement, t=
he
companies identified =01&governance structure/value-related issues and=20
integra-tion
of the two companies =01& as matters that would be discussed.
The two sides refused to make any further comments on the merger,
making unclear which side had raised questions about the original deal. The
companies gave no dates for the new talks, and they did not say if the merg=
er
is still targeted to be completed by the end of the year.
Under the terms of the July 29 deal, which was called a =01&merger of equal=
s,=018
shareholders in the two existing companies would turn in stock and receive
shares in the new merged company that would have a market capitalization of
$16.4-billion and $10.7-billion in debt and preferred stock. Also under the=
=20
deal,
FPL Chairman James Broadhead would become chairman of
the new group and Entergy head Wayne Leonard would be
president and chief executive officer. FPL would name eight
directors to the new groups=01, board and Entergy seven.
The announcement that the two sides would hold new
talks about the merger was made early Monday and during
the day common stocks of Entergy and FPL both slumped
but closed above their lows for the day and well-ahead of
year-before levels. Entergy traded as low as $36.25 before
closing down 60 cents (1.6%) at $36.90, up 85.1% from
March 20, 2000. FPL got as low as $60.50 and closed down
$2.44 (3.8%) at $61.81. It was Monday=01,s biggest loser among
electric stocks but was up 43.5% from March 20, 2000.
Under the July 31, 2000, agreement, FPL holders are to
get one share of a new holding company for each of their
shares, and Entergy holders are to get 0.585 shares. At
Monday=01,s closing price 0.585 of an FPL share was worth
$36.159, less than Entergy=01,s closing price, so the acquisition
premium would be negative 2%. Lehman Brothers downgraded
both Entergy and FPL Group from Strong Buy to Buy."

Thanks Jeff. 

Mike/Jeff:  FYI---all of our people are out of Gaza except four egyptians 
that are safe in Gaza city( a quiet area because no Israelis will enter).  We 
are working on a plan to get the egyptians safely back to egypt, but now is 
not the time for them to move.  ABB has pulled its people out so construction 
is stalled.  I saw some dramatic pictures on CNN here showing an Israeli 
helicopter hovering over our plant, shooting rockets into the Netzarim 
junction about a quarter mile away.

Andrew will be in London on Monday to initiate discussions with British Gas.  
I will follow up with Andrew/BG after he lays the groundwork.

Rick

Subject: Latest developments in Palestine

All borders to Gaza have now been completely closed for both Palestinians and 
foreigners, including a shutdown of the Gaza airport.  The Palestinians 
rejected the Israeli ultimatum, and an escalation of the conflict is widely 
expected to begin on Monday night.  

I have spoken with some Americans and British friends who had stayed in Gaza, 
and they  reported that their embassy's have called them, and warned them of 
a possible escalation following the expiration of Baraks 48 hour ultimatum.  
There is little that the embassy's have been able to do to help the people 
still in Gaza due to the political sensitivites and lack of cooperation 
between them and the IDF, but we should take note of their response, as 
confirmation that we cannot rely on their assistance in the future for 
evacuations.  When Jim Roundtree and I visisted the head of security at the 
US embassy, he warned that an evacuation of Gaza by the US embassy is very 
unlikely under any circumstances because of the difficulty of coordinating 
such an excercise with the US military, and the ""political message"" it would 
send.  

Regards,

Jeff

Hi there,

I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.  I'm fairly confident 
that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't called 
me back today to confirm.

Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.  Could one of you return her call 
for me?  I'm tied up.  You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a 
call.  I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than a 
few minutes.  I'll check with Ben.

Thank you,

Kay"

Would you mind asking the vault if they have these?  If not, could you get with Knudsen to get them?

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

We are ok with your Addendum to the agreement.  However,  there remains 
Section 3.2,  we discussed earlier.  Because this is interruptible gas we 
prefer Spot Standard. 

Also,  with regards to the signatory.  Is Mr. Roy VP for Atmos Energy 
Corporation?

I will prepare an additional GISB for United Cities.

Jeff

I have never been accused of being subtle.  However, someone had to say it 
and it is better to say it now than to have it come out later.

Phil


Dear David:

        I am writing this note to you and not the committee.  I am worried
that too many of the signatories can be accused of trying use their
academic positions to achieve results desired by their consulting clients. 
I riase this issue because more than one person has told me that ""Paul
Joscow is owned by Edison.""  While such statements are generally wrong I
believe you need to be sensitive to the potential attack.  In particular, I
worry that our efforts will be undermined if too many of the individuals
signing the report have had extensive dealings with the state's three
largest utilities.  I can just see the headline ""Apologists for utilities
offer solutions to state's energy problems.""  

        You know we will be attacked after we issue the manifesto.  The
question is, will the attacks have merit.  If we were all white as the
driven snow there would be no problem.  However, under such circumstances
we would all be poor. 

        For this reason it is important to get independent academics and
non-academics with no connections to the utilities or generators to sign
the manifesto.  I fall into this later category as, I believe, do a number
of other individuals.  The addition of Solow would obviously help as would
Arrow or McFadden.  Dale Jorgenson would also be a great addition because
he has never worked or testified for these firms.  The same goes for Paul
Krugman.  On the other hand, Pual brings some heavy baggage.  

        I understand it is important to have as many names attached to the
manifesto as possible.  However, Paul's name may hurt.
 
Phil

Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of 
the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to 
find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back 
in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My 
apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your 
patience.  SRS

Unfortunately I jump on a plane Thur at 430pm EDT and don't think that leaves 
enough of a gap to make Jeff's availability. Can we try to reschedule 
conversation?

I have copied my assistant, Tiffany Roach, on this message to help

Bruce,  Attached is an article I found in the Houston Chronicle business 
section yesterday.  Has a negative outlook, but mostly related to product 
supply B2Bs.    You probably are familiar with most of the B2Bs they 
mention.  Thought might be useful to you.  Good talking to you yesterday.  
The check better arrive this week or I start breaking your stuff one piece at 
a time.

CC,

Do you still have the contact info for the escrow agent?  If so, it would be  
great it you would contact them directly.

The turbine contract is going back and forth between us and GE.  I expect 
that it may well be ready tomorrow.

I expect the Enron opinion letter to be an issue.

Kay:

Note the following timetable from the final version of the ENA/PPL letter
agreement:

(1)  ENA agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the final
form of the turbine contract on or before April 11, 2001.
(2)  The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an
escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001.
(3)  The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of
(a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the
closing of PPL's financing.
(4)  ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19,
2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business
day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine
contract).
(5)  The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days
after funding the escrow account.
(6)  Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before
May 3, 2001.

If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001,
then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands.  PPL's obligation to fund
the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing.  Greg
Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give
an estimated date for financial closing.  

I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were
causing heartburn.  He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker.  He asked
today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be
appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point.  He also
requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions.  When you get a
chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for
PPL's review.  Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form
of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to
negotiate the fee.  Let me know if we can assist in this regard.  Thanks.

Steve,   As we just discussed, this is the transition memo suggesting that  
you place a call to Clay Johnson.   As noted in the memo, we are still 
working through with the lawyers what leave status our employees would be 
required to take while serving on the private transition and the publicly 
funded transition.  The answer to this question may determine their 
willingness to serve, in some cases.

I think this is a very interesting idea.  Please get with Bill D. and make 
sure he gets a description of what we would need to do to physically 
accomodate the station and make sure he's comfortable with it before we go

As part of our agreement with the Channel 2 WeatherNet program we were given 
the option to have a weather station at the Enron building. This would be an 
additional $5,000 on top of our commitment. I brought the idea to Gary Taylor 
and Todd Kimberlain in weather and they thought it would be a great idea to 
serve as the weather tracking spot in downtown Houston. They have agreed to 
pay the $5K for the equipment and installation. So now, in addition to 
Channel 2 mentioning ""WetherNet, brought to you by Enron,"" everytime they 
talk about the weather in downtown Houston, they will mention the current 
temp. at the Enron building.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 34535.

 As we have referenced in our monthly report,  Enron is involved in a dispute 
with Mr. Friedman concerning his involvement in a proposed natural gas 
transportation and marketing arrangement in the Republics of Mozambique and 
South Africa (the ""Pande Project"").   Mark Wawro at Susman Godfrey has been 
representing Enron Southern Africa Development and Enron Oil and Gas 
Mozambique in negotiations with the Friedmans' lawyer, Jim Reed, at Looper 
Reed. 
  On January 16, 2001, the above referenced lawsuit was filed despite the 
fact that the parties had recently met to discuss their respective positions 
and had agreed to exchange documents. The lawsuit was filed in the 133rd 
Judicial District Court of Harris County and, therefore, is pending before 
Judge Lamar McCorkle.  The defendants have not been served and the 
plaintiffs' lawyer has asked Mr. Wawro to accept service on their behalf. 
 The plaintiffs allege that the defendants  breached the subject consulting 
agreement by ""failing to honor and denying any intention to honor, their 
Development Fee and Investment Right obligations under the Consulting 
Agreement"". More specifically, plaintiffs seem to be complaining about a 
failure of the defendants to pay a percentage of the $30 million allegedly 
received in connection with  the transfer of defendants' interest in the 
Pande Project and termination of the plaintiffs' consulting agreement  The 
plaintiffs have also demanded an accounting as well as pre and post judgment 
interest.  A specific dollar amount of the damages sought was not provided.
 Please call me if you have any additional questions about this matter."

DATE: ??????????? July 19, 2000
 
RE:?????????????????? Contract Approval, AFEs and Consulting Arrangements

??????????? The following guidelines must be followed for all existing 
projects, as well as new contracts, AFEs and consulting arrangements.? 
 Contract Approval
??????????? Effective immediately, all contracts must be approved by legal, 
with the final version of the contract initialed by legal prior to 
execution.? Exceptions will be limited to the execution of crude oil 
purchases and sales contracts that are on a pre-approved form and occur in 
the normal course of business.? Any other exceptions must be approved by the 
Office of the Chairman.? In order to ensure that we have a handle on existing 
contracts, please provide a copy of any finalized contract which legal did 
not initial prior to execution, but is currently in effect or not yet 
performed, to Molly Sample by July 25, 2000.? 
AFEs
??????????? Based on my review of the latest AFE report, EOTT needs to 
utilize this tool to better manage all of its expenditures for budget 
purposes to ensure proper prioritization of EOTT's cash.? Company policy 
requires that all expenditures greater than $5,000 that relate to expansion 
capital and maintenance capital are required to have an AFE set up prior to 
any expenditure.? I have asked the property accounting group to monitor 
compliance with that policy starting today and hold for payment any 
expenditures not authorized according to the policy.? Effective immediately, 
all employees will be prohibited from starting any project that does not have 
an approved and signed AFE.? In addition to ensuring that the current policy 
is strictly adhered to, the policy will be broadened to include a) 
expenditures for environmental expenses captured on the EMS Works system and 
b) the use of blanket AFEs for small recurring asset purchases such as 
computer equipment (computer equipment under $5,000 would be capitalized 
under these blanket AFEs and no longer expensed).? 
??????????? In order to more accurately monitor existing AFEs, please be sure 
the following steps are taken for each AFE prepared by your department:? 1) 
obtain competitive bids prior to starting a project; 2) all projects for 
which costs are projected to exceed the approved AFE by 10% or $50,000, 
whichever is less, must have a supplemental AFE prepared and submitted for 
approval within 30 days of the projected budget overrun, and 3) any project 
that is in process and does not have an AFE must be put on hold until an AFE 
can be approved, and 4) any open AFEs that are fully completed (meaning all 
invoices have been received and routed for payment) must be closed.? A final 
capital and maintenance budget for all authorized (and still open) AFEs will 
be completed and distributed by July 25, 2000.
 ??????????? Please consult Joe Richards for information necessary to utilize 
the AFE System for all future AFE processing or for a copy of the AFE policy.
 Consulting Contracts and Service Contracts
 ??????????? Effective immediately, no new consulting arrangements may be 
entered into or extended without the approval of the Office of the Chairman.? 
Additionally, Human Resources/Administration must be contacted prior to 
entering into any consulting arrangements to 1) arrange for office space, if 
necessary for the project, and 2) to determine how the position should be 
filled (contract position, temporary employee, or permanent employee).? For 
all existing consulting agreements, please provide me with a comprehensive 
listing by arrangement, including terms and business rationale, by July 25, 
2000.? Please contact Molly Sample to prepare a contract for any undocumented 
consulting arrangements.? Written documentation on all consulting/contracting 
arrangements must be maintained by Human Resources in the event of any 
governmental agency audit of EOTT's contract employees. 
 ??????????? Contractors who provide various services, such as trucking, 
environmental cleanup, maintenance, etc. must execute a service contract and 
maintain a valid insurance certificate to remain on EOTT's approved 
contractor list, which is available on EOTT's Intranet.? Requests for service 
contractors must be sent to John Zimmerman in the Legal Department.? Please 
forward a request for contract to John for any service arrangements which are 
not documented by July 25, 2000.

Accounts Payable Documentation
??????????? Please be reminded that the Accounts Payable Department requires 
complete and timely documentation for all invoices submitted for payment.? 
This includes all charges made using a P card.? Incomplete invoices or copies 
of invoices will be returned to the submitting party.? For service contracts, 
a summary of hours, hourly rate, and a brief description of the work 
performed by person, by date, and by project, along with documentation to 
support specific authorized out-of-pocket expenses, must be submitted before 
payment can be made.? For materials, a comprehensive description of all 
items, including the quantity purchased, must be submitted before payment can 
be made.? 
 
??????????? Please notify the appropriate people in your respective 
departments of these procedures and contact me if you have any questions or 
comments.

In the final analysis, we did not make a lot of progress in reaching 
agreement to settle the RP99-507 proceeding on El Paso's capacity allocation 
proposal at the conference in San Francisco last week.

The parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of Burlington's 
concerns about timing.  We will  reconvene for settlement discussions July 12 
and 13 at Southwest Gas's offices in Las Vegas after comments and reply 
comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May 2 
technical conference at FERC.  Comments are due June 30 and reply comments on 
July 7.  Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September 21, 
1999, and requested fast-track processing under the Commission's new 
complaint procedures.  Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to 
the fast-track processing of the complaint, maintaining that an order should 
have been issued within 240 days (I don't know where they got that from -- I 
can't find any such requirement), and vehemently opposed any attempts to 
extend the procedural schedule.

The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris, representing the CPUC, 
was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by 1:30 (the meeting 
started about 12:30).  He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete 
opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June 6, and 
then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in 
violation of the '96 Settlement.  

After Harvey spoke, El Paso then reviewed its June 6 settlement proposal, 
which you received by e-mail, and provided some additional explanations of 
assumptions, etc.  Then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on 
their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss. 

Of particular note was the allocation of the 360 MM/d of San Juan-only 
capacity that El Paso proposed to take back from Burlington (97J4) and Amoco 
(97JB).  El Paso said that it had been allocated 106 MM to the Havasu 
shippers, 180 MM to the EOC shippers, and 74 MM to all others (California CD 
shippers).  This was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing 
discussions -- California shippers objected to EOC getting the lion's share 
of the additional San Juan capacity.  Under El Paso's proposal, EOC shippers 
would get 82% of their rights from San Juan and 18% from Permian, based on 
BDs.  CD shippers, on the other hand, get 61% and 39%, respectively.

EOC shippers pointed out that the BDs were not actually representative of 
their load.  BDs were simply a number negotiated among the EOC shippers to 
allocate the costs that were allocated between EOC and California in the '96 
settlement.  Certain EOC shippers suggested that their specified rights 
should be based on some other calculation, such as non-coincident peak day 
usage, rather than BD.

Another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers (FR 
shippers) be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the 
specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants (BD).  El 
Paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority 
superior to that of a CD shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm 
basis (either alternate receipt/primary delivery or alternate 
receipt/alternate delivery).  Of course, the FR shippers approved of the 
proposal but most other parties  objected to it.  Several suggestions were 
advanced to try to reach a compromise (for instance, limiting FR shippers to 
primary specified receipt point rights during Cycle 1 nominations), but none 
were accepted.  Most non-FR shippers stated concerns about the practical 
impact of giving FR shippers such a scheduling priority, particularly since 
El Paso's interpretation was that the FR shippers would not have to nominate 
any of their Permian specified rights in order to come back to the San Juan 
with  the systemwide rights.

Everyone pretty much agreed that El Paso's proposal for capacity release of 
receipt point rights (#4 in their write-up) was a non-starter.  It was put on 
the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that, if they 
could be made economically neutral to using non-San Juan points, they might 
be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights.  What they 
were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some 
further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive, stating 
that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case.

A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas doesn't 
consider El Paso's proposal not to sell Block II turned-back capacity to its 
Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they can't anyway.  
SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which 
it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCal/Topock.  However, SoCal Gas 
can't at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a 
specified right at Topock.  Conversely, all the other CD shippers who think 
they bought firm rights at SoCal/Topock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get 
all the rights unless they, too, can get out of their contracts.

Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point 
for certain parties -- some insist it has to remain in the settlement, others 
say there can't be a settlement if it stays in.  El Paso's proposal would 
move the fuel rate back to 4.85% effective 2/1/00 by changing the way they 
eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as 
gathering.  In the filing to be effective 2/1/01, the rate would go down to 
approximately 4.4% and then to 3.88% on 1/1/03.  Burlington insists they will 
opt out of the settlement if they don't get relief on fuel.  Apparently, to 
the extent El Paso doesn't include the costs of compressors that Burlington's 
gas utilizes in systemwide fuel, they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El 
Paso's gathering affiliate.  They say it has already cost them several 
million dollars (I heard numbers between $9 and $27 million -- no hard data), 
and they will not settle without getting something in return.  

After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday 
afternoon, Rick Miles, the FERC ADR facilitator, pushed for individual 
meetings between the various segments (EOC, California, producers, marketers, 
El Paso), based on several parties' representations that they were willing to 
continue talking.  A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took 
up the morning on Tuesday.  Just before lunch, the entire group got back 
together and accepted Mr. Miles' suggestion that each segment select three or 
four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the 
issues.  He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some 
understandings.  However, it apparently didn't work because he called us all 
back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion, where the positions 
outlined above were stated and restated.  Certain parties, when pressed, 
could not agree to certain basic principles because, they said, they would 
have to get input from others in their organization.  Mr. Miles expressed his 
frustration that parties were at the table who didn't know what their bottom 
line position was (e.g., SoCal Gas, Southwest Gas).  Following discussion by 
the producers, particularly Burlington, as noted above that they would not 
agree to an extension of the date for filing comments, the next settlement 
meeting was scheduled after the filing dates.  Mr. Miles requested that 
parties send him an e-mail note that would state their bottom line settlement 
position, which he would keep confidential.  He would review all the 
positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement 
package of his own.  He assured all that no one would be able to identify the 
individual positions from his package.

One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the 
pooling committee's report.  No one registered any complaints, although a few 
parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that 
they would like to participate.

 This is how I see our bottom-line position.  I would like to send it to Rick 
late this week if everyone agrees.

A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both 
market and supply with no restrictions on pool-to-pool transfers (loops 
allowed).
Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract, or, preferably, 
termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to 
others as part of a settlement.
Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point 
rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate 
delivery points, although no objection to using some allocation method other 
than billing determinants, such as peak day volume, to establish those 
specified point rights. 

Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCal/Topock rights?  Please 
give me a call when you've had a chance to look this over.  I'm sure you'll 
have some questions!  Also, we'll need to talk about what kind of comments we 
want to file."

Biggest impact was lower retained fuel volumes.  Overall impact is around $=

Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated =
flow I was showing on the outage report was 130 mmcfd, (per Eric Faucheaux =
Planning) and the actual affect is 180 mmcfd.

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/=
01 to 12/01/01) Darrell is going to post something on it today.

I also had a WT2 outage on the report that the field was asking for. It sho=
wed a complete Station shut down for 24 hours. Darrell and I talked the fie=
ld into moving it to next year. (Early March) If you have any questions let=
 me know.

Jim - overnight I realised you need to add our project in Turkey (Fiona 
Grant) and Poland (Philip Davies).  I have not given you any one person, as 
the regulatory issues seem to be country/environment specific, and instead I 
have given you the names of each person with country responsibility.  Indeed, 
at year-end we completed a financial transaction (Project Margaux), in which 
regulatory risk was reviewed.  A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be 
helpful, e.g., in most of these markets, trading arrangements are being 
re-written, or developed for the first time, this put existing PPAs under 
pressure.  Would energy taxes, carbon taxes/trading, transmission pricing 
(both for evacuation of power, and delivery of gas), changes in property 
tax/fuel tax regimes, risk of price regulation, all be included?  Do you have 
checklist?  We can identify these risks, what is meant by ""manage""?  We work 
on these types of issues on a daily basis, so I am unclear as to what else is 
intended or implied.  thanks  mcs

Subject: Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets

Rick & Mark --

One of the first steps in building our Regulatory Risk process is to 
establish responsibility for the current assets owned/managed by Enron.  
Having a point person that I can contact will help me immensely.

Attached is a listing of the assets that I have been able to pull together -- 
there may be more that you know about.

Is it possible for us to agree upon the person(s) who will manage the 
Regulatory Risk with each of these assets?  Please feel free to call me to 
discuss.

I would like to have this assignment process complete within the month.

The same type of effort will be necessary as we review pending transactions.

Thanks.

Hi,

Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
I intend to return to the office.

My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.

Stan

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)

Thanks for your response on this. I thought that in principle many of the 
hedges we used would be harmless, however, I would feel more comfortable with 
a more detailed review with you, particularly since one of the hedging 
transaction types involves the use of Enron stock.

Let me know when would be a convenient time to brief you.

Dave:

I read Gordon Bethune's comments is the Chronicle this morning and if he concerned about Continental's solvency, the other carriers must be even more at risk.   As Bill and I are traveling, could you help in asking for a recap of our Airline positions?   We probably should identify the universe of names.   Given the high operating leverage in this industry, coupled with lease leverage, it does not take much to go negative.   For United and American I would imagine access to CP and revolvers would be potentially problematic.   I will be Bill at about 6:45 before we leave, if this is already in process, I'll leave a voice mail.

Regards,

Michael

ENRON SHIFTS CASH TO DEMOCRATS
Just before bankruptcy, Enron gave $100K to the Democrats. Its
lawyer calls it business as usual.

GROWTH AHEAD FOR AVON

maintains double-digit earnings growth. 
http://tm0.com/forbes/sbct.cgi?s=167547968&i=436405&d=2153581

GUILT-FREE GUZZLING
At today's gasoline prices, the nutty ideas to improve auto
efficiency don't make economic sense. 
http://tm0.com/forbes/sbct.cgi?s=167547968&i=436405&d=2153582

GAMING ON A PDA
If handhelds are all about productivity, why are there so many
games for them? 
http://tm0.com/forbes/sbct.cgi?s=167547968&i=436405&d=2153583

THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS
At least once in your life you should stay at the Hotel Ritz in
Paris. 
http://tm0.com/forbes/sbct.cgi?s=167547968&i=436405&d=2153584

Dear  Mr Lay,

As  you may be aware, the Tata Energy and Resources Institute- North Americ=
a =20
(TERI-NA) is a publicly owned not-for-profit research organization=20
incorporated  under section 501(c)(3) in 1990 in Washington D.C, at the=20
initiative of TERI  (Tata Energy Research Institute), New Delhi. The genesi=
s=20
of TERI-NA is rooted in  the realization that emerging global concerns abou=
t=20
the energy and environment  must bring together new partnerships between=20
developing and developed countries  through active communication and=20
collaboration.=20

In recent years, the South Asian  region,?has experienced an increasing oil=
=20
demand-supply mismatch, thereby  pointing to a growing dependence on import=
s=20
and?enhancing energy security  concerns in the region. It is=20
therefore?pertinent to identify strategies  that need to be developed and=
=20
implemented in a proactive manner so as to enable  an effective response to=
=20
supply disruptions, and to reduce oil import dependence  through fuel=20
diversification, diversification of the sources of supply, and  specific=20
technological interventions.

?India  and the United States have sought a revitalized relationship betwee=
n=20
the world's  most powerful and largest democracies. For the South Asian=20
region, the message  has been one of continuing interest in ensuring peace=
=20
and stability. The timing  is therefore appropriate to undertake a program=
=20
that would facilitate dialogue  between energy producing and consuming=20
countries, identify opportunities for  integrating regional energy markets,=
=20
and assist in enhancing investments in  clean and sustainable energy=20
development.=20

With  these objectives in view, a one-day workshop on =01+Energy Security=
=20
Concerns and  Response Strategies for South Asia=01,, is being organized wi=
th=20
support from the US  Department of Energy, on February 10, 2000, in New=20
Delhi. The workshop is being  organized in conjunction with TERI=01,s 1st D=
elhi=20
Sustainable  Development Summit, which would focus on the challenges that=
=20
underlie global  sustainable development, requiring unprecedented efforts o=
n=20
the part of  governments, corporate organizations, and civil society.=20

?Our  initiative in organizing this workshop is intended to complement the=
=20
efforts  that are already underway for ensuring a stable and secure energy=
=20
sector in the  region. As a follow-up to the workshop, it is proposed to=20
disseminate the  discussions and proceedings thereby ensuring a wider=20
understanding of issues,  and to undertake cooperative research under each=
=20
priority  area.

?In  view of Enron's pioneering efforts in securing safe and stable global=
=20
energy  developments, we would be very grateful if?Enron could consider=20
providing  financial support for this workshop to the extent possible, as=
=20
well as  participate in the workshop. I am enclosing a copy of the proposal=
=20
for your  consideration and would be happy to provide any further  details.

?I  look forward to receiving a favorable response from you.

?With  warm personal regards,

?Yours  sincerely,

R.K  Pachauri

President

Tata  Energy and Resources Institute

This is great.....  After it opens you can stop the cat by clicking on the
cat then exit.  We did not know and the cat just kept on appearing in our
screen.  Mine is saved to my desk top so I have a cat wandering around on my
banner screen.

Mark can we put togethr a term sheet for the below deal. I think it would be 
along the lines of a licensing agreement to use a version of EnronOnline that 
allowed Natsource to transact with Enron on the behalf of various 
counterparts. The transaction attempt would identify who they were attempting 
to transact on behalf of. The deal would be a one year deal @ 200K payable 
upon delivery of the application.

Let's discuss.

I have no problem with any of your three points.  I would prefer a two year

Jack,
I should have set the time for 30 days. If it is 15 we will automatically
renew for another 15 days and therafter if apporpriate.

Here are my thoughts:

1). I think we will need to go to phase II immediately. From a legal and
control standpoint, doing the trades as Natsource with a give up to client
at end of day gives us a lot of heartburn. We don't really know who we are
dealing with and even with the margin it could put us in violation of
certain board authorized policies. The good news is that my head IT guys
thinks giving you a client application with a ""pick list"" is not a lot of
work and could be turned around in fairly short order.

2). We will make Natsource the first broker customer to have this app as
long as you guys are willing to work with us.

3). We are more interested ina one year deal at $200K.

Let's start negotiating, and see if we can't paper something prety soon. I
would think the technology could be turned around within 60days of signing.

Let me know,
Andy

Kate, we have created the confirm that represented the original deal.  Total 
400 mws, we have sent the confirm to Idaho, broker confirm matches original 
deal, Melissa said we usually do not reconfirm deals that were cut.  We have 
put a comment in deal entry commenting that the deal was cut.  Just as long 
as you have all recorded on your side, with the mws.  Hope this helps.   
Thanks Sp

Subject: Re: Deal 565759.01  

I'm sorry my response has been such a long time coming on this issue, but 
I've visited with almost every department in our office trying to figure out 
what happened to this deal. Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the 
Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So 
Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he 
found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which 
they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the 
schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to 
Idaho in the hour-ahead market. 

Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better 
if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and 
kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation 
of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.

Thanks,
Kate

rate is 
??????? less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? 
Bid Rate x

Can either one of you help me...

Calpine- does not know Deal QF1735.1-traded by John Arnold.

Deal QF1336.1 is the exact same trade terms, but is brokered through GFI and 
traded by Mike Maggi.

Calpines thinks these are duplicate trades-and only knows the QF1336.1
Their trader is Thomas McAndrew @ 713 830-8640

Calpine has short-paid by 136,990 due to this trade.

Please let me know if the trade by John Arnold is valid-
Thanks so much

Carl,
I was traveling on Friday.  The Doubletree is the closest.  I'll get you a number.  Dinner on Monday is a good idea.  If you have a 5:30pm flight, leaving the office at 3:00pm will give you enough time to return a car and get to the terminal.

Is the closest hotel to the Enron office the Doubletree?  Do you have an
address or phone number?

I was thinking that perhaps we should plan to have dinner on Monday evening.
This would be a good opportunity to get acquainted.  Are you available?
Please let me know as we have not made our airline reservations.

I think we will take the 5:30 flight back to Minneapolis.  I assume that we
should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we
need to leave earlier?"

Susan, 
We had the best time.  Good friends, great experiences, weather , etc.  Now 
we all want to move to  Denver.  I am glad that Bens outfit worked out so 
well.
I thought it was cute and I could picture him wearing it when I purchased 
it.  So-------are you still planning the retreat weekend?  I am soooo 
jealous.  I would love to go but as I said I can not justify the expense.  
Any consideration to something a little more modestly priced?  Do you already 
have the plans made?  
Call me or write me back.   Hey - I am getting more and more excited about

Greetings:
On the subject of SBX2 18, this is where it stands:

I.  Article IV Section 10(b)(3) of the Cal. Const. states that any bill
presented to the Governor that is not returned within 12 days becomes a
statute.   So, the Governor has 12 days to sign or veto a bill; unless ...

II.  Section 10(b)(1) says that any non-reapportionment bill passed by the
Legislature on or before the date of adjournment for interim recess that
arrives to the Gov. after the adjournment, that is not returned within 30
days becomes a statute.  So bills passed in the last week, that because of
the enrollment process do not find their way to the Gov. until after
adjournment have 30 days.

III.  Section 10(b)(1) does not apply to Extraordinary Session bills- they
always have 12 days to be signed or vetoed.  However, the clock does not
begin ticking until the Gov. receives the bill.  This last point is the
kicker.  Burton is still holding the bill in Enrollment.  So it can remain
there until:
	1. Burton frees it from Enrollment and sends it to the Gov. at which
time
it has 12 days to be signed or vetoed;
	2. The Legislature returns either sometime this fall or in Jan. and
forces
the bill by motion to the Gov. (not likely);
	3. The Legislature returns and adjourns the Snd Ex Session.

For all intents and purposes the bill is dead ... the Gov has indicated it
would be vetoed and so Burton has held it.  Burton is either holding it to
save it from a certain veto, or waiting to send it until a possible shifting
in the political sands."

Please, take a final look at your sections. I have made no changes or minor 
cosmetic changes.

The overall presentation time is limited and we have to limit every presenter 
to a  maximum
time allocation of  5 minutes (strictly enforced).

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I have now reviewed this matter with Rob 
Milnthorp.  The status of Bank of Nova Scotia's financing arrangements to our 
counterparty Beau Canada Exploration Ltd., which was recently purchased by 
Murphy Oil  Canada Ltd., remains unclear.  However, until such time as that 
has been clarified, including the Bank of Nova Scotia's consent to our 
security for our mark-to-market positions with Beau Canada (now Murphy Oil 
Canada), Bank of Nova Scotia should not, at the request of Enron Canada, be 
added to EOL.

Justin, Enron Canada is currently in an unresolved dispute with Bank of Nova 
Scotia where from our perspective Bank of Nova Scotia has essentially been 
telling us to shove off.  The dispute involves BNS's purported requirement to 
consent to collateral security given to Enron Canada for physical and 
financial trading positions with a counterparty known as Beau Canada.  
Neither Bank of Nova Scotia nor any affiliate of Bank of Nova Scotia should 
be traded OnLine and all trading ought to be monitored until such time as 
this matter is resolved, and this should be expressly communicated to Bank of 
Nova Scotia.  They can speak to me directly at 403.974.6923 or to our 
President and CEO, Rob Milnthorp at 403.974.6714.

I am copying this memo to Bill Bradford and Mark Taylor for their information.

Last night's kick-off for the Children's Book Drive was a huge success.  We had a fantastic turn-out, raised $970 and collected three boxes full of books.  Many people wrote personal inscriptions in the books to the children reminding them that they were in our thoughts and prayers.  Enron Corp has offered to match our contributions 2 to 1, making the total contribution from the pool $2,910.  

The drive is not over yet!  We will accept books and cash until September 28th.  You can come by and visit us on the 35th floor to make a donation.  

We are looking forward to seeing everyone in October for our Halloween Social!  This event is going to be hosted by EGM.  Stay tuned for more details.

Thanks again for a fantastic evening.

Ghosh/LON/ECT@ECT
cc: Scott Sefton/LON/ECT@ECT (bcc: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT)
Subject: Credit Derivatives (CDs) in Sweden

I have been through the advice received from Swedish counsel. The position of 
CDs under Swedish law can be summarised as follows.

1.  Regulation

CDs are regulated in Sweden in the same way as commodity derivatives. As 
discussed we are currently working through these issues as they relate to 
commodity derivatives with local counsel and I will be pressing them to take 
a less cautious approach than they have taken to date (particularly in light 
of our expanding presence in Sweden). As you know, our target is to avoid 
Swedish licencing requirements and the accompanying regulatory capital 
requirements. In the meantime, this uncertainty will not prevent us from 
dealing in Norway with Swedish parties based in Norway.

2.  Insurance

CDs are not analysed as contracts of insurance under Swedish law.

3.  Guarantees

  CDs are not analysed as contracts of guarantee under Swedish law.

4.  Gaming

CDs are not analysed as gaming contracts under Swedish law and (unusually) we 
do not even need to go so far as to satisfy ourselves that the contract is 
being entered into by the counterparty for a valid commercial purpose (i e 
hedging).  However, it should be noted that several types of entity may not 
enter derivatives at all for speculative purposes (e g municipalities, 
insurance companies).

5.  Confidentiality

This could be an issue for Enron even where we are selling the CD, where we 
have good reason to believe there is breach of the purchaser's duty of 
confidentiality owed to the reference credit (i e where we are not in good 
faith). The position would of course be potentially more problematical where 
we are purchasing the CD.  That said, it would be difficult in either case 
for the reference credit to establish loss (e g  damage to reputation), so it 
would be hard for them to launch a claim.  Our exposure could be restricted 
further by passing on no more information about underlying reference 
contracts than is absolutely necesssary.   I am pusuing this further with 
Clifford Chance, in particular to find out what the practice is in the London 
and New York credit derivative markets where the issue of confidentaility 
arises and I will revert to you when I have more information. Perhaps 
Merrills could shed some light on this?

6.  Subrogation & Assignment

Since CDs are not guarantees there is no right of subrogation.  It is 
possible to take an assignment of the counterparty's rights against the 
reference credit, but this will not work so as to allow Enron a right of set 
off against the reference credit where Enron is aware of the reference 
credit's insolvency at the time of the assignment (a reasonable bet) or where 
the latter becomes bankrupt within three months of the assignment.  In 
effect, this will make it very difficult indeed to extract any value at all 
(including by way of set off) from the reference credit.

Please feel free to call me on x 6566 to discuss this and to pass this note 
on to other interested staff.

Best regards

Paul

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Per our telephone conversation, I am attaching my resume for your review. As 
we discussed, I am seeking a permanent (Manager level) position where my 
finance and origination skills would be best leveraged.  I am very interested 
in a role in financing and/or orginating energy deals - wholesale or retail.  
If you or one of the groups interested in interviewing me require a 
reference, please contact my current supervisor, Rob Gay, or current and 
former colleagues Peter Anderson and Greg Blair, respectively. 

Thanks again for your help and advice.

Regards,
Tracee

Your order is here.    Your total is $43.56.  I am training someone today so 
look for me in my blue sweater and ponytail.  I should be somewhere in the 
area.

Oh my god--so much desire to run, but i have a dinner tonight--my last since 
it's time to get into shape.  Maybe I'll wire my jaws shut.  If my dinner is 
with a 19 yr old, I'm going to take the fork and poke holes in myself.  (That 
was my dream) 
I'll tell you about it tomorrow...

As you may have gathered by now, the West Origination Group has purchased 
season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to 
championship glory. We have four seats which will be used primarily to 
entertain customers and foster outside business relationships. 

Please look over the attached schedule and determine the game dates you would 
like to reserve. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve 
basis, so be sure to plan as far in advance as possible. Games that have not 
been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given 
to outside parties. 

http://www.nba.com/blazers/schedule.html#CURRENT 

If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, contact Blazer 
Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person.

Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest 
counterparty list:

1.  CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis 
transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column 
CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only
2.  Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather?
3.  Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved
4.  Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list.  
What happened?
5.  Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA 
Master Agreement this week
6.  UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be 
restricted for all other products
7.  Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in this week
8.  Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather
9.  EIL Petroleum-missed no weather
10.  Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD 
weather swap is ok
11.  Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not 
a utility.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review 
our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the 
regulatory people.  I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I 
hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading."

Hi Savita,

Jennifer and I have been looking through the ICE volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly  all of their really huge Nat Gas volumes are being done on firm, physical, CUSTOM trades. It's probably a good bet that these ""custom"" products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website, but are instead closed, large-scale transactions done between the various ICE entities as a means of pumping up their volumes.

I've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these ""custom"" deals and have spoken with Bob Shults to see if he has any contacts at ICE that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are. He hasn't called anyone yet, however, and I've asked him not to until you and Andy have had a chance to go over this. 

Could be something, could be nothing...

Torrey

There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
""Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct""
""Enron Activity - ICE""

 

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

503107 and 503112 have both been changed to reflect the correct time zones. I 
checked the strips after changing them to PPT and it looks like Deal Entry 
separated them correctly between PST and PDT. I'm working on the rest now.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when 
they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

Greetings,
I would suggest calling Duke early to make sure that they are aware of this 
obligation.    They need to resupply for this hour, regardless of their cost.
If they pull up lame,  of  course,  we will resupply and bill them LD.
If you have major problems with this,  dont hesitate to call Donald or myself.

Thanks,

Yes, I thought the job sounded great!  Do you know anything about how long
they pursue their own employees before they turn it over to the public?  I

Thanks.  I'll call Tino back and tell him not to fret about what he heard 
from Maddox --I know Tino and Dennis knew about the Cobisa project and I 
think he believed Maddox was working on yet another project.  I can get Tino 
comfortable without breaching our confid. agreement with Maddox by just 
telling Tino that we understand there is just one project down South of our 
target location, not two.  Also, I'll let Tino know that early April looks 
like the best time to get together to talk numbers and we'll call to set it 
up when we are ready.  DF

Subject: Re: Pueblo: CONFIDENTIAL  

Drew - Good timing.  Here's what I know:

1) Jack Maddox and I have spoken sporadically in the past about very nebulous 
projects in areas near TW.  (We even have a signed Confidentiality Agreement 
with him!)  After I read your memo, I called him to see what's going on.  

He is working on a 220 MW gas-fired plant near Belen, NM.  Houston-based 
Cobisa Corp. will ask the city of Belen to issue industrial revenue bonds to 
help it build this plant.  Power generated by the plant will be sold to 
customers through service agreements with electricity moving along existing 
PNM lines.  Plans call for construction to begin by Spring 2001 with 
operations to begin by 2003.  Kevin and I have a meeting scheduled with him 
next Friday, March 31 in Albuquereque.  We'll keep you posted.

2)  I received the economic analysis today which factors in some of Dennis 
Langley's wish list.  The ""as good as it gets"" rate, assuming the project is 
sized at 150,000 MMBtu and fully subscribed over the project life of 10 
years, is $.1631.  This does not include a) any ROW cost, b) a 50/50 split of 
any incremental revenue TW receives on its existing line as a result of 
additional capacity sold to serve new markets, or c) 25% of ownership in the 
assets and 25% of the cash flow stream after payout.  

 I need to continue working the economics with James Centilli.  In the 
meantime, our consultant, Mark Baldwin will hopefully provide us with 
critical market information near the end of March. This is also around the 
time when Tino should have his report on detailed the cost estimate of 
construction and environmental issues.  Maybe we should rally first part of 
April to see where we are.

Here's the latest Tino-gram:
1.  Tino's environ. consultants have not discovered any stop signs.  

2.  The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant 
as well as the pipeline.  The power plant could be located on Isleta land 
adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation.  Thus, the power 
plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without 
ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land.  PNM would not be necessary to move 
power to DOE.  Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant 
optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.  (maybe  this 
could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia 
reservation?)

3.  Dennis is using Jim Slattery, an ex law partner of mine in DC (and ex 
Dem. U.S. Congressman from Kansas), as his primary contact with  Bill 
Richardson at DOE.  My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship 
with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective.  Tino reports 
that ""DOE is OK with the deal"" and the next step is negotiating the power 
contract itself.  Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the 
project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly 
thin.   It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery 
promised DOE.

4.  Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says 
he's working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen.  Tino thinks he's 
working for the Laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big 
power plant out there.  Is this ours?  PNM's?  El Paso?  

Finally, the next key step is obviously the economics.  Based on what Tino 
told me, I'm convinced that Dennis and Tino don't have a real good sense of 
how much $$$ might be in this deal.  They are groping a bit and our initial 
analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.  How are those 
efforts coming?  

Thanks.  DF

attending, please let Amy FitzPatrick know no later than May 21st.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:    Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:  8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical 
understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that 
are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how 
financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management 
needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; 
its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration 
disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines 
that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward 
curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and 
transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of 
price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship 
between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, 
explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various 
customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more 
favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using 
embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing 
implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum 
prices, etc.

I have drafted a detailed outline on our receivables due from the underscheduling penalty.  Because the penalty has not been implemented by the CAISO, our case needs to clearly lay out the CAISO has failed to implement FERC orders and what our receivable is even though we have no invoices to rely on.

The biggest ""to dos"" on this are: (1) update our receivable amount to the extent we can get more data from CAISO (we have asked for data informally from CAISO), (2) lodge discovery questions re: the computation of our receivable (I drafted questions in Section 5), and (3) review Enron's past positions on this matter.

I am assuming that sections 1. and 2. will go in our pleading and/or policy testimony and that sections 3. AND 4. will be beefed up and/or updated by Murray O'Neil (with help from Stokley and Blair).  

I am on vacation from 8/11//01 - 8/24/01 so please look at this ASAP so that I can answer any questions before I leave.

John,

Included is an updated diagram of the proposed Chase prepay that includes 
Stoneville - please let me know if you have any questions.  With regard to 
Stoneville, Enron Hydrocarbons Marketing Corp. entered into an agreement in 
December 1994 whereby Enron would sell to Mahonia and buy-back from 
Stoneville (Stoneville Aegean Ltd) - a transaction very similar to this 
prepay.  Thanks.

Michael

Subject: RE: Corporate Officers / Confidentiality Agreement

Robert, this is something that we are going to need to credibly market this 
opportunity.  We are dealing with governmental bodies and officials and 
titles are important.  No capital is being committed and the LLC has no 
assets.  This is not part of our mainline business and imposing a ""set slate"" 
doesn't seem to me to make sense.  What approval is required?  Dick.

Typically, our officers and directors is a set slate.  There have 
occasionally been exceptions to this, but we would need to get that exception 
approved before we could create the positions described.

Subject: Corporate Officers / Confidentiality Agreement

Robert, please set up the following Delaware single-member LLC, wholly owned 
by ENA:

EnronExec, LLC

Officers:
Richard A. Lydecker, President/CEO
Mark D. Meier, Senior Vice President of Business Development
Patrick L. Johnson, Senior Vice President of Operations

Please let me know if you need other information, such as SSNs or other 
identifying information.

Regarding the confidentiality agreement, can you please draft a template for 
a two-way agreement?  I would rather suggest a format with which we are 
comfortable from the start, rather than negotiate the counter-parties' 
template with them.  I believe we have a better chance of getting what we 
want that way.  Also, you may use the EnronExec name in the C.A.  Make sure 
that the C.A. includes language to protect against all information learned on 
Enron as well as specific language prohibiting the use of the Enron name in 
any of the counter-parties' correspondence, advertisements, etc. without the 
express written permission of Enron (we will yield to your judgement on 
language).

Please phone or e-mail if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help.

-Pat

Hey folks.  Mr. Jackson makes some very good points, which I'd like to 
include.  However, before I work them in, wanns make sure that everyone 
agrees with his comments, since including some of his will require some 
modifications to the direction that the memo takes.  We could discuss in a 
brief conference call if folks wish.  Also, please review what I've done--not 
major edits, but edits (with some questions and additions) nonetheless.

Best,
Jeff

The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

Team
We are doing much better with interviews (See below). Thanks & keep up the good work. Please complete assignments on time. In addition, we need each SME as a minimum to allot 4 hours a week towards this project, which will significantly increase the potential for the end product to ""Exceed the Mark & Expectations.""

Quote for this week: ""One should always bloom, where one is planted.""

Have a great weekend and I hope to see all of you on the Oct 24th Boat Ride.

Thanks for your great efforts thus far.

Cheers

It has been brought to my attention that the Mieco ISDA has not been received 
by the company.  Could you let me know if there is any hold up or perhaps if 
we need to trace the package?      Thanks

Hope all is well.  Wanted to make sure that the ISDA has been received by
you.  My last recollection was that Mary Cook had agreed to all of your
requests.  Please respond when you get a chance.

Selexol Plant - has been sold to Tanoma for $200K.  Wire transfer received 
today.  I have called Montauk and informed them and withdrawn from further 
negotiations with them.  FYI - we never accepted their offer.
Austin PPA - was sold to EDI for $150K.  Wire transfer received yesterday.
Steve and Geoff are pursuing the sale of the blower and flare from the Austin 
project, potential $30K.
Current cash projection (based solely on money in the bank) through the week 
ending Nov. 3 is + $135K.  The rent for the Austin office for Oct has been 
paid.  This number also includes $20K for Nov's rent (due 11/1).  This 
provides some breathing room (time-wise) to continue trying to execute the 
strategy of an orderly liquidation in order to maximize Ecogas' ability to 
satisfy its obligations with its creditors.  
Our meeting today with ZAPCO re: the purchase of the company via a stock swap 
went ok but my confidence level a deal can be done in the timeframe required 
is very low due to complications on their part.  We are exploring another 
structural option - at ZAPCO's request.  The ball is in their court and they 
know we are continuing to pursue other alternatives.
Discussions with Inter-Asia Venture Management (IAVM) continue to both 
progress and expand.  In addition to Rosenberg IAVM has expressed a direct 
interest in Ecovest and McCommas.  Considering McCommas represents the bulk 
of current value, IAVM has now elevated their interest to buying Ecogas Corp. 
as a whole rather than on a piecemeal basis.  Again, the ball is in their 
court and they are demonstrating a real sense of urgency to make something 
happen.  They are well aware of the time constraints.
Frito-Lay/McCommas Bluff - F/L senior management does not want to ""get into 
the landfill energy business"" (at least directly) and brought in a third 
party intermediary.  After detailed discussions and due diligence on their 
part, the third party was not willing to put forth a formal offer.  Their 
intermediary does not have the capital to close the deal and is not willing 
to put his current assets at risk.  As a result, we have escalated 
discussions with another entity who could provide the same interface with F/L 
and whom would be acceptable by F/L.  This will also be dependent on the 
probability of the IAVM and/or ZAPCO discussion referenced above.
Skyline/Westside - a bid request package was sent out to approximately 8 or 9 
industry participants with bids due 10/23.  To date only one company 
responded with a very low bid and a lot of ""contingencies.""  There are at 
least 2 other companies who called and expressed interest in bidding but have 
not yet submitted their bids.  EDI has requested permission to visit with WMI 
directly and get a read on the Gas Rights Agreements and their willingness to 
work with them.  At this point, I don't think we should agree.  Depending on 
how discussions with IAVM and/or ZAPCO progress, this will require a 
judgement call as to whether or not we should proceed with this transaction.  
Any input from the rest?
FYI - Felipe Vega, the controller for Ecogas, has tendered his resignation 
effective Monday, Oct. 30.  Kelly Mahmoud will assume the necessary role to 
keep things in order.

Given the updates above, we are still pursuing parallel and simultaneous 
paths of either selling the company outright or strategically liquidating 
assets with our focus on McCommas Bluff.  Feel free to call if you have any 
questions or would like to discuss in more detail."

Well, it's over.  My mom passed away last night at 12:30 after a year long 
battle with pancreatic cancer.  I was in Texas with her for the past 5 days 
taking care of her and spending time with her.  The funeral should be 
Thursday in Texas and then the burial will be in Oklahoma on Saturday.  
Thank you all so much for your prayers, your support, sending Mom cards, 
driving me to the airport and doing whatever you could do for my family and 
me.  I couldn't have been so strong throughout this year if it weren't for 
the wonderful support of my friends.  I love you all.

Rebecca

Chris, we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few
days.  We need to do some programming work.  If you guys would go ahead and
pay the bill, it'll be washed out in an adjustment hopefully next month.
The bill itself is correct, it's just on the wrong contract.
Let me know if this is ok with you.   Thanks, ii

Dear E204-1 and E204-2 students,

Regarding the Team Assignment #2, I neglected to put the point-count in the 
Points Scoreboard on page 1.? The points assigned should be:
Problem 1:??? 8 pts
Problem 2:? 12 pts

On Personal Problem Set 5 (due May 3/4), the note says NOT to use Linear 
Programming to 
determine the EST, EFT, LST, and LFT times for each activity but instead 
determine them
manually as in lecture.? This direction should have referred to 15.9 (b) and 
(d), so Linear
Programming should not be an issue for the homework.? Creating a spreadsheet 
in part (e)
can be done from the text examples and the spreadsheet example that you have 
in your
Project Management handout (p11).

Elizabeth Joy will hold the Review on Saturday for those looking for 
additonal 
insights on simulation and the initial topics of project management -- 
defining the
network diagram (activity on node), deriving the Early Start Times,  
Early Finish Times (+EST + duration), Late Finish Times, Late Start Times 
(=LFT - duration), 
Total Slack (=LST-EST), Free Slack, Safety Slack, Unshared Slack (=Min{Free 
S, Safety S}),
Critical Path, Project Duration, Linear Programming formulation to Min 
Project Time, etc.

Terry: I am pleased that you will serve and appreciate your question asking 
for objectives and goals.  The goal is to get information defining what each 
Enron group wants in energy services liberalization. Second is to have them 
define by country the impediments to our businesses that we want addressed in 
a WTO energy services negotiation and third, what groups or companies in 
various regions of the globe can we enlist to lobby their government in 
support of an energy services agenda.

Ideally I would like to have input by January 15, 2000. Perhaps we can all 
meet in Houston about that time to exchange written information, discuss it 
and plan a strategy for 2000.

I will attach the questionaire that Bob Fisher of the Hills group prepared 
from the Rachel Thompson paper that was distributed to Energy Services 
Coalition members in November and asked that they complete it by the middle 
part of December which is today. So far we have had very little response.  
The WTO is to meet in Geneva this week to decide a schedule to consider 
""services"" starting this year. Despite the fact that Seattle did not launch a 
formal round of negotiations, the Uruguay Round concluded seven years ago 
mandated that the WTO begin negotiations on agrucultural and services 
liberalization in 2000. The next formal meeting of the WTO is January 25 in 
Geneva.

Joe

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate (atleast some of) the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

C. Engel"

Subject:	Update

I've talked several times with Scott Gerson of the Focus Group about the list of candidates he has presented to you.  He says that Sriram is ""ready to go"", but that the other NY guys are ""kinda iffy"".  He did say that they may become more interested in Houston if they don't receive NY job offers within the next week or so. We have scheduled Sriram to come in to interview with the group on Thursday, 4/19, beginning at 9:00 am with you, Vince.   I will keep you posted if I hear anything more from Scott.

Spoke with Jinbaek Kim today, and he is very excited about the offer to do a summer internship with the Research Group.  We will get his offer letter out to him tomorrow, but he has indicated a definite verbal acceptance.

I'll be in tomorrow, but off Friday.  Please call me with any questions you might have.

Thanks,
Molly

Professor Titman:
I received an e-mail from Meg Brooks in the admissions office stating that I 
would be hearing from them this week.  I hope things work out and I can be 
contributing to and learning from the program next year.  Thanks again for 
all your help.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Yes, Sorry, forgot to mention it to you, but nothing was set in stone.    In 
fact, I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you.  Are you free?, are 
they free?, I don't even know if I'm free.  What did they say?"

George, 

Are you looking into these variances?

The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please 
review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk 
scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in 
January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.  
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the 
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for 
the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is 
the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.

Kenny,
Attached is the worksheet that I have been using to verify Cilco's storage 
balance with Vonda Seckler from Cilco.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.

Hi Gerald,

We're still alive and kicking.  I made some changes to the LOI.  Can you 
check it over - I'm hoping to send it over to Corey at the end of the week.

Thanks,

SDG&E filed a Complaint with the FERC that requests an ""emergency order 
capping at $250 per MWh the prices"" for all parties selling into the Calif 
ISO and the Calif PX.   SDG&E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are 
""fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable 
competition"".

EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved 
EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market 
power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh 
into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.

Government Affairs is responding in two ways --

1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
market-based rate authority.

2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.

The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
August.

This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
discuss this with you.

Call with questions.  

Thanks,

Jim"

Stacey, figured out where 88MM of our 89MM difference is between the two portfolios. Duplicate deal with Powerex. Mid C is out about 1MM so I will look at it when I get back.

Call me at home if needed.

We are getting the Enron treatment from Coral.  I hope Carolyn told you I 
called yesterday - Coral was looking for Shell approval.  I'm guessing it is 
in a coma.  I usually have 30 voice mails, and I have had 4 today, which 
tells you something.  Good  time for Michael to be sick!  

Carlos has interviews today and tomorrow with ENA.  I think he is looking 
good for Mexico.  You guys are the absolutely best qualified for that 
business, and I'll start planting that seed when I can. 

By the way, thanks for the great job on Coral.  Did you hear from Rose on the 
HSR on TurboPark?  

We do want Astros tickets for next year - at least 15 games.  Are more 
available?

I heard that Hampton had an issue with Patty Biggio (thank goodness, these 
salaries are absurd), and I guess I'm glad to see Ausmus come back.  However, 
he is not a substitute for a pitcher.  And how is Shane?

Ciao,

Kay

		 Subject: FERC's Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for CA Wholesale 
Electric Markets

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will 
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  
All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, 
will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) 

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission 
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  
Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, 
within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs 
in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  
(24-7)  

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. 

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 
or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due 
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold 
of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate.  In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited 
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within 
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  
Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.  

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PG&E bankruptcy filing.  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
keep you posted.

Calif ISO Cuts Power Refund Estimate To $6.1B From $8.9B    =20
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 11:53 AM=01;ET    =01;=20
=01;

By Mark Golden=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20


NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's estimate of how much the state was=20
overcharged by power suppliers dropped to $6.1 billion from $8.9 billion wh=
en=20
an adjustment requested by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge was=
=20
taken into account, according to data submitted to FERC last week.=20

The California Independent System Operator's estimate fell when the grid=20
operator excluded power bought by utilities not under its purview, and its=
=20
estimate could fall again as it works in other recommendations made by the=
=20
judge following the conclusion of 15 days of talks between power suppliers=
=20
and the state over potential refunds last week.=20

Even as the ISO continues to recalculate its refund estimate, however, the=
=20
state is sticking to the original $8.9 billion figure, which has been calle=
d=20
arbitrary by critics. The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes ""a=20
potential framework for settlement discussions,"" Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'=
s=20
chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.=20

FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9=20
billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not=
=20
negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refund=
s=20
due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700=
=20
million.=20

Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refun=
ds=20
and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.=20

The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to=20
municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through=
=20
the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the Californi=
a=20
Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of=20
those purchases, the ISO made estimates.=20

""We know the volume (of the bilateral deals),"" Hildebrandt said. ""The refun=
d=20
amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market.""=
=20


Resetting The Baseline=20


Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the=
=20
ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law f=
or=20
California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition=
=20
to sales to the California Department of Water Resources.=20

The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp. (PCG, news=
,=20
msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International (EIX, news,=
=20
msgs) unit Southern California Edison ran out of cash in January. DWR has=
=20
also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20

In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fa=
ir=20
prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by=
=20
retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19. Those=20
controls set prices by the operating costs of the least efficient generator=
=20
needed to meet demand each hour.=20

But last week, after Hildebrandt completed his $6.1 billion estimate, Wagne=
r=20
recommended to FERC commissioners that the June 19 price control formula be=
=20
modified when used retroactively to determine refunds.=20

Those modifications, if applied to the ISO's estimate, would cut refunds mu=
ch=20
further. For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averag=
e=20
of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner=20
recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is=20
considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices wou=
ld=20
cut potential refunds sharply.=20

Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back =
as=20
Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about=
=20
one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.=20

ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of=20
Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May=
=20
2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.=20

""The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the=20
overcharges going back to May should be repaid,"" McCorkle said. ""We just=20
maintain that position.""=20


FERC Baseline Questioned=20


In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when=
=20
fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the pric=
e=20
cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have=
=20
been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet=20
demand.=20

That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generato=
rs=20
be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.=20

Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to=
=20
$7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.=20

One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt=
=20
said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units. Considering=
=20
only the least efficient generator actually used would make permanent the=
=20
rewards for such withholding, he said.=20

""The judge is in error to suggest that the actual (least-efficient) unit us=
ed=20
would have been called on if the must-offer requirement were in effect,""=20
Hildebrandt said in an interview.=20

In arriving at his estimate, Hildebrandt determined the difference between=
=20
actual sales prices and what prices would have been for every seller and fo=
r=20
every hour since May 1, 2000, had price controls been in effect. The ISO=20
released only the total potential refund, not the company-specific shares.=
=20

Hildebrandt took issue with generating companies that have complained his=
=20
numbers aren't justified.=20

""These are based on very tangible records,"" he said. ""The idea that it's a=
=20
black box is misleading.""=20

Mary,

Hope things are going well with you and yours! Nigel and I were discussing 
some contract language today and wanted some input from you on how we might 
word future grants of options or stock. Should we be wording Director Level 
and below agreements with a more generic ""equity"" component instead of 
specifying options or restricted stock? My question revolves around our 
tendency from time to time to change the structure of how we deliver value as 
a company. Your thoughts? What are others doing?

Dave, attached is our settled form of product description and GTC we have 
prepared for a HDD Australian weather swap. The GTC has been prepared on the 
basis that the GTCs will apply even in instances where there is a Master 
Agreement with the counterparty.     

Susan/Heidi - I  would also like a specific sign off from someone (presumably 
Price WaterhouseCoopers) that the input tax status of commodity derivatives 
(as outlined in the Australian Tax Office Consultation Paper on the 
application of GST to financial services) will extend to weather derivatives.

We are preparing similar documentation for the following, HDD swap, HDD Call 
Option, HDD Put Option, CDD Swap, CDD Call Option and CDD Put Option.

Interested in any feedback.

As a result of restrictions that Market Axess has imposed on users of its 
multi-dealer online bond trading site, we will not begin using the site until 
trading of high yield bonds is implemented late this year.  

Legal:  I suggest that we defer legal discussions until this date 
approaches.  

Credit Approval:   This will not be an anonymous site, where our credit 
exposure is to the site or clearing broker.  Our exposure for Market Axess 
transactions will be to one of their participating dealers.  My understanding 
is that we have trading agreements with each of Market Axess' current dealers 
(JP Morgan, Chase, Bear Stearns, ABN Amro, Deutsche, UBS Warburg).  Please 
let me know if there are credit issues related to trading with these dealers 
through Market Axess.  Before we begin trading, we will determine if there 
are any new Market Axess dealers for whom credit approval is required.

Please let me know if you like to discuss.

Thanks.

I'm throwing out my thoughts on question 1 for the current case.

1.  Evaluate Patten's business strategy.

    My first thought centered around the fact that Patten's real expertise is
in real estate development.  They have a well thought out strategy of who the
customer is and how to sell effectively to these customers.  They have
developed a good business relationship with the large property owners.  With
little risk they analyze their ability to subdivide the properties.  Once
this is completed and the land purchased, they unleash their marketing
strategy.
    The marketing strategy seems to effectively gain sales without
extravegant costs.  The sales staff is custom designed to relate personally
to the average customer.  Their gross margin for land sales is 54.8%.  Even
if you include the selling, general and admin expense their margin is 24%.
    The part of their business strategy I struggle with is the finance
business.  What do a bunch of land developers know about finance.  In my
opinion land financing should be left to the experts.  If they established a
preferred financing company, they could negotiate a standard finders fee for
the loans.  More importantly they would eliminate the risk in their revenue
streams.  When they make a sale the revenue could be immediately booked since
they would not hold the debt, the finance company would.  Their current
portfolio of notes receivable is $18.6M.  It looks like ignoring expenses
their financing margin is 3%.  This only gives $0.56M in revenues.  This
number seems prett
